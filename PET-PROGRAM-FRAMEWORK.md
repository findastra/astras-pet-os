# Pet Program Framework

The standard every pet program follows: what its page shows, how its tools, data, versions, backlog and agents
work, and how security patches reach every farm. Written from Astra's instructions of 2026-10-13 by Claude Opus 5.5;
the page layout redrawn from her sketch of 2026-10-18 by Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`), 2026-10-18.
**Every new pet program is built to this, and every existing one is brought up to it.**

> 🐾 Everything inside the harness is an animal. Agents can only control animals. L4 approves everything that matters.

## 1. Words (developer language, no marketing)

| Word | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **L1** Programs | The third-party programs it runs, plus the programs and tools it creates. |
| **L2** Pet program | The pet's dashboard and its runtime: it runs by itself (schedule, checks, inbox, saved state). |
| **L3** Agentic harness | An AI model sits in the pet program's harness, becomes its agent, and does its tasks with its tools and tricks. |
| **L4** Verified human | The verified human who owns the entire secure ecosystem (on Astra's farm: Astra). Every security change, every permission and every exception to a default is approved by L4. On another user's farm, that user is L4. |
| Pet program icon | The character (Friendly Farmer). |
| Pet program | The one main program a pet stands for (The Farm). |
| Tool | Any other program, page or section a pet program owns. Same ring and permissions as its pet program, never more. |
| Tool box | How a tool appears on a page: a bordered box with its versioned label on the top border and everything about the tool inside. |
| Connection box | How a link to another pet appears: a box with a border of its own colour (never the tool box colour), titled with just the other pet's **pet program icon** name, as if the two are talking. Inside: what flows each way. |
| Third-party | Programs, libraries and services made by others. |
| Maker agent / checker agent | The agent that proposes and applies a change, and a separate read-only agent that verifies it (the maker-checker rule). |
| Backlog | The never-lost list of notes, screenshots and change requests for a pet program. |

## 2. Names and versions: everywhere

Versions start with `v`, like git tags. A name keeps its number; a version never hides inside it.

| Thing | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Pet program (no name yet) | `pet-program-<#>-v<version>` | `pet-program-3-v1.0` |
| Pet program (named) | `<pet-program>-v<version>` | `the-farm-v1.0` |
| Icon (mood 1 to 9) | `<pet-program>-v<version>-icon-<mood>-v<icon version>` | `pet-program-3-v1.0-icon-2-v1.0.png` |
| Tool box label | `<pet-program>-v<version>-<tool>-v<tool version>` | `pet-program-3-v1.0-notes-tool-v1.0`, `the-farm-v1.0-astras-pet-os-system-map-v1.0`, `pet-program-5-v1.0-harness-strapper-v1.0` |
| Backlog (the store) | `<pet-program>-backlog` | `the-farm-backlog` |
| Backlog entry | `<pet-program>-v<version>-backlog-<YYYYMMDD>-<NNN>` | `the-farm-v1.0-backlog-20261013-001` |
| Weekly backlog run | `<pet-program>-v<version>-backlog-run-<YYYYMMDD>` | `the-farm-v1.0-backlog-run-20261019` |

The backlog store is the one name without a version, on purpose: it belongs to the pet program across every version,
so it is never lost. Every entry and every run inside it carries the version it was written against.
Mood numbers: 1 calm, 2 blink, 3 happy, 4 curious, 5 worried, 6 sad, 7 sick, 8 shocked, 9 asleep.

## 3. The page, top to bottom

### Layout (Astra's sketch, 2026-10-18): this order wins over the list below

![Astra's sketch of a pet program page, 2026-10-18, drawn for the Unity Unicorn](docs/images/pet-program-page-sketch-20261018.webp)

This sketch is the **minimum every pet program page contains** (Astra, 2026-10-18). It replaces her sketch of
2026-10-16, which was never saved here; the Unity Unicorn's page is the example. Dark slate stationery and light,
hand-lettered text. Every group is a **module**: a thin bordered box with its label set into the top border, in
lowercase-with-hyphens. **Every module can collapse**, so the page works on a phone. The tool, notes and connection
boxes from the list below go inside the matching module here.

1. **`<pet>-cyberhome`** (top left, square): the pet's habitat. The desktop pet comes to live here while the page is
   open. Its paired lights sit on the top edge.
2. **Title** (to the right of the cyberhome): the **home (pet program) name**, large, then `V<semver> // <YYYYMMDD>` on
   the same line. The sketch shows `The Unity Den   V3.0.0 // 20261016`; the name itself always comes from
   `pet-programs.json` (AGENTS.md, "One list of names").
3. **`<home>-pet-program-quick-summary`** (box under the title): one to three plain sentences: what the home is, who
   runs it (you and the pet), what it organizes, and the intention behind it. Taken from the pet's mini-descriptor.
4. **`<pet>-intelligence-levels`**: one module, in columns:

   | activity status | intelligence level | 3rd party programs | your programs (L1) | your tricks (L2) | your tools (L1) |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | one light per level | L1, L2, L3, L4 | made by others, run by the pet (Unity, VCC, VRChat) | made by you, looked after by the pet (Piranesi House, Unity Unicorn Icon) | skills the seated AI follows (weekly-update-from-friendly-farmer, weekly-copyright-auditor) | code the pet program owns and runs without AI (copyright-collector, copyright-auditor) |

   **○○ before every item: the paired lights.** Left light: **green** on, **red** off. Right light: **blue** working
   correctly, **yellow** requires maintenance (yellow replaces the orange of 2026-10-16).
5. **`<pet>-session-notes`**: a notes text box with **submit** and **add file**. Every submission goes to the backlog
   (section 7) straight away, before anything else happens. This is the notes tool box from the list below.
6. **`<pet>-emotions`**: the nine moods, each drawn as the pet beside a speech bubble that says when it shows.

   | Sketch | Mood frame | Shows when (Astra's sketch) |
   |---|---|---|
   | sleepy | `sleep` | it is running in the background |
   | awake | `blink` (proposed) | the program is open and you have interacted with it recently |
   | idle | `idle` | the program is open and you haven't interacted with it recently |
   | curious | `curious` | an L3 agent requires L4 authorization or input |
   | happy | `happy` | it just pushed new information; it has an L3 suggestion for a workflow; ideas or work are ready |
   | worried | `worried` | missed runtimes, missed checks, failed audits, token overusage |
   | alarmed | `alarmed` | a connected source reports an active alarm; a potential or active security breach |
   | sick | `sick` | too many broken tools; broken pet programs |
   | sad | `sad` | it hasn't been opened in more than 2 weeks |

   These meanings are not the mood key the Farmer's rounds use today ([PET-FILES.md](PET-FILES.md), "What each mood
   means"; [MOOD-KEY.md](MOOD-KEY.md)). Until Astra picks one set, the rounds keep the mood key.
7. **`<pet>-clicker-training`** (beside the emotions): what clicking the desktop pet does. One click: show the current
   reminder. Two clicks: open the pet program. Three clicks: refresh the tools and the tool list. More can be assigned.
   A click runs a **tool** (code, no AI; AGENTS.md, "Tools vs tricks").
8. **`astras-pet-os-unified-footer`** (bottom, wide): one shared footer for every pet program, also used on pages
   outside them; each pet program customizes its own. It is a tool, so it has one owner and other pages use it by
   grant (section 11). It holds item 10 of the list below.
9. **`<pet>-chat`** (fixed, bottom right): the paired lights and the circle-arrow button that opens the pet's chat bot.

### Required, but not in the 2026-10-18 sketch yet

The rules below and in sections 4 and 12 still need a place on the page. Each waits on Astra to say which module it
goes in.

- **L3 and L4 contents.** The 2026-10-16 layout gave L3 the seat (model, task, since) and the L3 activity bubble, and
  L4 the approvals waiting on you, sick reports and the pet passport. The new sketch shows both levels only as lights.
- **The status line** (item 2 below): whose data, last entry, last update, the seat, and the link to its own System
  Map node.
- **ON/OFF and sick on every tool, enforced by the core** (section 4). If the paired lights are the switches, they are
  buttons, not only lights.
- **A "not on this PC" state.** A missing third-party program is not an error (section 4): it shows asleep, not red.
- **Connection boxes** for the pets it talks to (item 6 below), each with its own ON/OFF.
- **Links by kind** (section 5), **backlog health** (item 8 below) and the **pet passport** (item 9 below).
- **The alarm's red banner** across the page (section 12).
- **Lights that do not rely on colour alone**: red and green look alike to many colour-blind people, so each light also
  needs a word or shape (WCAG 2.1, success criterion 1.4.1).
- **One mood when several apply** (alarmed and sad at once, say): an order, most urgent first.

**One source for the page:** each pet's `pet.json` holds an `intelligence_levels` block, with `L1` (`third_party`,
`native`, `tools`) and `L2` (`tricks`). The page draws its boxes from that block, so the page, the map and the audit
always agree. [docs/pet-page-review-20261016.md](docs/pet-page-review-20261016.md) shows what each pet has today.

### Older detail (still required inside the boxes above)

Every pet program page is made of tool boxes. Each has a border, its versioned label on the top border, and
everything about that tool inside it.

1. **Icon tool box** (top left): the current mood icon, labelled with its full icon name
   (`pet-program-3-v1.0-icon-2-v1.0`).
2. **Status line** (always visible):
   - **Data:** whose data is showing (the user's handle, never a legal name).
   - **Last entry:** date of the user's last entry.
   - **Updated:** date of this pet program's last update to itself, with its version.
   - **Seat:** whether an AI is in the harness now, which one (Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT, a local model) and its
     task: a tool of this pet program, or a chat, Codex task or project name. It reuses the presence structure of
     `anthropic-discord-presence` and `openai-discord-presence` (app, model, project, task, since). "Seat: empty"
     when no agent is working.
   - **On the map:** a link to the System Map focused on this pet program's own node
     (`…/system-map-20261012.html#node=<node-id>`), where it shows connected to the Friendly Farmer.
3. **Notes tool box** (`<pet-program>-v<version>-notes-tool-v<version>`), near the top: a text box, screenshot upload
   and a **Submit** button. Every submission is saved to the backlog straight away, before anything else happens.
4. **Chat tool box:** a chat bot drawn as the pet program icon. On first visit it asks whether it may use the user's
   own AI subscriptions (Claude, ChatGPT, local models, whatever they have) and remembers the answer on that device;
   the user can change it any time. It signs in through the user's own accounts; no API key is stored in the page.
5. **The pet program's own tool boxes**, one per tool. Every tool box has:
   - an **ON/OFF** switch (a kill switch): OFF stops the tool at once, for a suspected security breach;
   - a **sick** checkbox: "this tool is broken from my point of view" (it goes to the Farmer's
     `broken-tools-on-the-farm` and to the backlog), with **Take it to the vet-clinic** to ask the community
     (section 10);
   - its version, what it does in one plain line, its links, and how it is used. A Unity Unicorn tool such as
     `harness-strapper` links its download on the title and lists which avatars it is rigged on.
6. **Connection boxes**, one for every other pet this pet program talks to. They use a different border colour from
   tool boxes, and the title on the border is only the other pet's icon name (for example **Log Lynx**). Inside:
   - **Sends:** what this pet program sends to it, and why (for example "status: my health, daily");
   - **Receives:** what it gets back, and why;
   - the other pet program's name and version, small (`pet-program-48-v1.0`), and the scope L4 granted;
   - the last exchange (date and time) and whether it worked;
   - an **ON/OFF** switch for the connection, so a suspected breach can be cut off between two pets without turning
     either one off. The same rules apply as for tools (section 4).
   The flows come from the same relations the System Map draws, so the page and the map always agree.
7. **Links tool box**, grouped by kind (section 5).
8. **Backlog health tool box:** healthy / needs attention / unhealthy, with the L3 agent's diagnosis of what is
   unhealthy, the date of the next weekly run, and the schedule.
9. **Pet Passport tool box** (`<pet-program>-v<version>-pet-passport-v<version>`): its microchip (signature), pedigree
   (where it came from), passport stamps (installs and updates), vaccination card (security patches) and vet records
   (vet-clinic tickets). See [PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md).
10. **Footer:** the coding languages used, from the repo; credit "by Astra" and the license; signature status.

## 4. Tools: ON/OFF and sick, enforced, not just shown

- **Missing programs are not errors** (Astra, 2026-10-14). A pet first checks whether the programs it looks after are on
  this PC. If they are not (a friend without VR software running Rift Rabbit, say), the pet shows **"not on this PC"**
  (the asleep mood, 9) and sends nothing. It never raises errors, alarms or tickets for software that was never
  installed. Developers call this feature detection, or graceful degradation.

- The ON/OFF state lives in the core (the Farm), not in the tool's own storage, so a compromised tool cannot turn
  itself back on. The runtime checks it before the tool runs; the checkbox on the page only asks the core.
- Anyone on the farm may turn a tool **OFF**. Turning it back **ON** after a security OFF needs L4 approval and is logged.
- **The Farmer's `broken-tools-on-the-farm`** tool box lists every tool marked sick, turned off, or failing its
  health check, across every pet, with which pets use it.

## 5. Link kinds

Every link sits in one group and carries three badges, so nobody has to guess what it is.

| Group | What goes there |
|---|---|
| **Home** | Its node on the System Map; The Farm |
| **Source** | Repo, releases (versions), changelog |
| **Tools it hosts: public** | Hosted tool pages anyone can open |
| **Tools it hosts: private** | Tools that open only on this PC (local only) |
| **Third-party it uses (external)** | Programs, libraries, services and AI models made by others |
| **Data it reads or writes** | Local folders and APIs, each with the scope L4 granted |
| **Pets it works with** | Shown as connection boxes (section 3, item 6), not as plain links |
| **Docs** | README, PROTECTION-RINGS.md, this framework (with the version it follows) |

Badges: **who made it** (Astra / third-party) · **where it runs** (this PC / local network / hosted) ·
**who can see it** (public / private).

## 6. Data: never lost, always transferable

- Data lives outside the code, per user and per pet program, not per version:
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\astras-pet-os\<pet-program>\` on the PC (pages that run in a browser keep it in browser storage
  and export to the same folder).
- Every data file records its `schema` version. Every new pet program version ships a **migration**. An update
  installs the new code, copies the old data to a dated backup, then migrates. Nothing is deleted.
- Updates carry the user's data to the new version on their own farm automatically (on Astra's farm: her local
  session). **Export** and **import** (JSON plus images) move data to a new device or version by hand.
- The backlog is medium sized: up to 2,000 entries or 200 MB. Past that, finished entries move to
  `<pet-program>-backlog-archive`, which is kept too.

## 7. The backlog and the weekly run

- Each entry: `id`, `created`, `author` (handle), `kind` (note, screenshot, bug, change request), `tool` (which tool
  box it is about), `text`, `attachments`, `status` (new, queued, in run, done, declined), `run`.
- **Weekly by default.** The L3 agent's scheduled run bundles every new entry, with its screenshots, into the next
  task prompt (`<pet-program>-v<version>-backlog-run-<date>`). Running more often costs more tokens, so it needs L4
  approval.
- After each run the L3 agent updates **backlog health** and says what is unhealthy (stale entries, duplicates,
  entries with no tool, screenshots with no description) and how it will improve as the backlog grows.

## 8. When something breaks: detect, fix, check, approve, roll out

Example: a pet program's link to the System Map is broken.

1. **Detect.** Log Lynx's health checks find the broken link. The Farmer watches Log Lynx's own heartbeat, so a
   silent Log Lynx is noticed too.
2. **Known fix?** If a runbook (an existing protocol) covers it, run it. No AI is needed.
3. **New issue: maker agent.** The L3 agent opens an incident and drafts a fix on a branch, using only allowed pets
   (Platform Platypus, Wifi Butterfly, Log Lynx, …) and only for each tool's declared intended use. Those
   declarations live in the core, where the maker cannot edit them.
4. **Checker agent.** A separate agent with read-only access reviews the proposed change: is it within the
   declared use, within permissions, and does the diff do only what it says? Ideally a different model or
   provider, in its own context, seeing the diff and the rules but not the untrusted input that caused the
   incident. It cannot edit.
5. **L4 approves.** Every security-related change notifies L4, who sees the request and authorizes it or not.
6. **Roll out in stages.** L4's own farm first; other farms pull the signed release; automatic rollback if health
   checks fail.
7. **Record.** Log Lynx writes the incident and the approval to an append-only log. It records approvals; it can
   never create one. L4's approval is the proof, signed with L4's security key once signing is in place.

Two agents that disagree escalate to L4 after two rounds.

## 9. Security patches for every farm

- The framework is versioned (this file's version is in each pet program's `pet.json` as `framework`).
- Patches ship as **signed releases**. Each farm's Friendly Farmer checks for them, verifies the signature,
  quarantines the update, and installs it when that farm's L4 approves. That farm's L4 may opt in to installing
  signed security patches automatically.
- Nobody pushes into another person's farm. Farms pull; GitHub is the only shared place.

## 10. Is your pet sick? The vet-clinic (community help)

Astra's PetOS is meant for anyone to adopt: an open-source personal AI platform that its community keeps healthy,
the way Linux distributions take bug reports and fixes from their users. The **vet-clinic** is where that happens.

- **What it is:** a public issue tracker on GitHub (the only shared place; farms still never connect to each other).
  A farmer whose pet is sick opens a **ticket**; other farmers diagnose it and may offer a **cure** (a code fix,
  as a pull request or patch).
- **Names:** ticket `vet-clinic-ticket-<NNNN>`, titled `<pet-program>-v<version>: <what is wrong>`; a cure is
  `vet-clinic-ticket-<NNNN>-cure-<N>`.
- **Before a ticket is posted** (on the farmer's own PC): only the sick tool's code and the error are attached, never
  private data. name-eraser and the secret scan run first, and the farmer's L4 approves the exact text that goes out.
  Private pets (health, finance, memes, privacy tools) post a description and the error only, never their code.
- **Trust tiers**, highest first. Every answer shows its tier:
  1. **Official:** signed releases from the project's maintainers.
  2. **Kennel-verified:** pets and fixes reviewed and adopted through the Kennel.
  3. **vet-clinic community:** answers and cures from other farmers. **Every one carries a warning:** unverified
     code from someone you do not know. It never runs automatically.
- **Using a cure:** treated like a pet from another farm (the sick cow rule). It goes into quarantine, a checker agent
  reviews it against the ticket, and the farm's L4 approves it before it runs.
- **Everything is logged.** Every ticket, answer and cure stays on GitHub, and Log Lynx keeps the farm's own copy.
  Cures that work for many farms are reviewed by the maintainers and become official patches, so community fixes
  improve the whole platform.
- **Who runs it:** until a professional security engineer joins (when teams begin), the project's maintainer (Astra)
  is the moderator, with a triage pet that labels tickets, checks for leaked secrets, and runs offered cures in an
  isolated test (CI). The triage pet never merges anything.

## 11. Tools, tricks, shared tools and the Shed

Full explanation with four real examples: [TOOLS-AND-TRICKS.md](TOOLS-AND-TRICKS.md).
- A **tool** is code the pet program owns; a **trick** is a skill its L3 agent has learned, shown in a trick box
  (`<pet-program>-v<version>-<trick>-trick-v<trick version>`) with its origin, the tools it uses and ON/OFF.
  A trick never brings permissions of its own. **Skill Scout** keeps track of every trick.
- **Shared tools:** one copy, owned by one pet program; other pets get a **grant** from Iron Gates (folders, R W X,
  limits), approved by L4 and shown in both pets' connection boxes.
- **Third-party tools and tricks** come through **the Shed** (like the Kennel, for tools): quarantine, checker agent,
  L4. Trust tiers: official, Shed-verified, community (with a warning).

## 12. Agent keys, the Police Station and the alarm

Every agent, ours or **external**, needs a **key** to operate a pet. That is how a break-in is caught and traced.

- **Short-lived key per session.** Gatekeeper Goddess (Iron Gates) issues one for each agent session. The key records
  which agent and model, which person, which device and where, which pets and grants, and when it expires.
  No key, no access. A stolen key stops working soon and points back to where it came from.
- **API Fairy shows every key** on the API Fairy Ring, in the `api-fairy-ring-v1.0-api-fairy-mushroom-circle-v1.0`
  tool box: active keys float inside the mushroom circle with a list beside them; expired keys leave the circle and
  go into the chest (old keys), with their own list. Keys themselves are never shown, only who, what, where and when.
- **Pet Police Officer (The Police Station) watches** every W (write) and every key use, live, and looks for
  unpermitted agent changes. It may **switch a tool, connection or key OFF** at once (containment), never ON. It alerts
  Gatekeeper Goddess, so her decisions are not made on tampered ground, and L4.
- **The alarm** when a break is happening now, or a past breach is found: Pet Police Officer jumps onto the desktop
  with a siren, every pet page and the System Map show a red banner, the affected nodes flash on the map, and L4 gets
  a phone notification. A past breach is marked "found, not active".
- **Security jobs, no overlap:** Gatekeeper Goddess decides who may do what and issues keys and grants. Pet Police
  Officer watches, alarms and switches OFF. Log Lynx keeps the records. Forensic Ferret investigates past breaches.
  API Fairy shows the keys. L4 approves.
- **Farmhands:** the AI models that take the seat are farmhands, not pets. Only farmhands on the allowlist get a key,
  and trust is earned in levels ([security model](docs/security-model-20261018.md)). A pet program never trusts a farmhand by itself.
- **Shutdown and recovery:** on an alarm, keys are revoked, agents stop and agent network is cut (containment, not a
  crash). Rescue Retriever (The Recovery Room) rebuilds and restarts the farm in the safe order; only L4 turns
  anything back on ([security model](docs/security-model-20261018.md)).

## 13. The first run: How to Take Care of Your Farm!

When someone first installs Astra's PetOS, it opens straight to the **System Map**. The Friendly Farmer appears in a
chat, the way he does at The Farm, and walks them through **How to Take Care of Your Farm!**, a tutorial (a trick of
The Farm). Its steps are still to be written with Astra.

**Seeds for you.** With the user's OK, the Friendly Farmer's seed-suggester (a tool of The Farm) reads the names of
the programs installed on the PC, read only and never leaving it, and suggests seeds: pets he can hatch for them, and
pets they could adopt from the Kennel. Every example pet on the map also offers **Make one like this for me**, which
copies a request for the user's own AI to start a seed like it on their farm.

## 14. Checklist for a new or updated pet program

- [ ] Names and versions follow section 2 everywhere: repo, files, icons, tool box labels, backlog.
- [ ] `pet.json` lists `framework`, every tool (name, version, intended use, public or private) and its links by kind.
- [ ] Page has every module of Astra's 2026-10-18 sketch (section 3), in that order, and every module collapses on a
      phone. Every tool box has ON/OFF and sick; every connection box has its own border colour, the other pet's icon
      name as its title, sends and receives, and ON/OFF.
- [ ] Data is outside the code, with a schema version, a migration, export and import (section 6).
- [ ] Backlog and the weekly run work, and backlog health shows (section 7).
- [ ] The map link focuses its own node. Languages show in the footer.
- [ ] Its tricks are in trick boxes and known to Skill Scout; any shared tool it uses has a grant from Iron Gates.
- [ ] Every agent that operates it uses a short-lived key from Iron Gates; it reports every W to the Police Station.
- [ ] Plain developer language throughout; no marketing.
- [ ] Follows [PROTECTION-RINGS.md](PROTECTION-RINGS.md): it is an animal only once L4 lets it in.
