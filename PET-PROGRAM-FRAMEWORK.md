> Footer correction, 2026-10-15: combine status, attribution, date and links in one centered horizontal row, framed by thin lines above and below. Separate items with a vertically centered sparkle with 0.5cm CSS margins on both sides. Let clearly separated groups wrap into spacious, slightly staggered rows on narrow screens. Never add a horizontal footer scrollbar.

> Owner correction, 2026-10-15: coins are retired across all Pet Programs, including footer icons. Use Chip's original yellow cell-phone shell, green LCD and black outline for every chatbot. Preserve each pet's actual chat and connection state. A cyberdeck redesign comes later. This supersedes all coin and non-phone styling instructions below.

# Pet Program Framework

> Owner requirement, 2026-10-16: every Pet Program includes the yellow **[Pet name] · L3 activity** bubble from the README auditor, with a green LCD and black outline. Keep it visible near the top, separate from chat. Use the shared `apps/pet-l3-activity-20261016.js` and CSS through `scripts/embed-l3-activity-20261016.mjs`. Flash Audit A52 is mandatory.

The activity bubble is read-only. It shows the actual provider, task, session, update time and a bounded history of concise events from a trusted local adapter. Default to **Disconnected / Seat: empty**. Never convert page visits, ordinary browser actions, declared model names or simulated timers into agent activity. OFF, errors and stale feeds stay explicit; a feed older than two minutes must not appear live. Keep event summaries free of credentials, private prompts and raw tool output; render them as text. Opening the page does not start an agent. The in-page API is a display adapter, not authentication or a permission grant.

Adapters call `window.astraL3Activity.receive({repo,status,at,provider,task,session,events})` with a fresh ISO observation time and `{at,message}` events, or dispatch `astra-l3-activity` on the document. Status is one of disconnected, idle, working, awaiting-review, complete, error or off. The repo must match the page. Duplicate snapshots do not rewrite the log; retain at most 80 events. Runtime acceptance requires observing a real job, disconnect, OFF and staleness separately from source checks.

The standard every pet program follows: what its page shows, how its tools, data, versions, backlog and agents
work, and how security patches reach every farm. Written from Astra's instructions of 2026-10-13 by Claude Opus 5.5.
**Every new pet program is built to this, and every existing one is brought up to it.**

> 🐾 Everything inside the harness is an animal. Agents can only control animals. L4 approves everything that matters.

## 1. Words (developer language, no marketing)

| Word | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **L1** Programs | The third-party programs it runs, plus the programs and tools it creates. |
| **L2** Pet program | The pet's dashboard and its runtime: it runs by itself (schedule, checks, inbox, saved state). |
| **L3** Agentic harness | An AI model sits in the pet program's harness, becomes its agent, and does its tasks with its tools and tricks. |
| **L4** Verified human | The verified human who owns the entire secure ecosystem (on Astra's farm: Astra). Every security change, every permission and every exception to a default is approved by L4. On another user's farm, that user is L4. |
| Pet program icon | The character (Friendly Farmer). |
| Pet program | The one main program a pet stands for (The Farm). |
| Tool | Any other program, page or section a pet program owns. Same ring and permissions as its pet program, never more. |
| Tool box | How a tool appears on a page: a bordered box with its versioned label on the top border and everything about the tool inside. |
| Connection box | How a link to another pet appears: a box with a border of its own colour (never the tool box colour), titled with just the other pet's **pet program icon** name, as if the two are talking. Inside: what flows each way. |
| Third-party | Programs, libraries and services made by others. |
| Maker agent / checker agent | The agent that proposes and applies a change, and a separate read-only agent that verifies it (the maker-checker rule). |
| Backlog | The never-lost list of notes, screenshots and change requests for a pet program. |

## 2. Names and versions: everywhere

Versions start with `v`, like git tags. A name keeps its number; a version never hides inside it.

| Thing | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Pet program (no name yet) | `pet-program-<#>-v<version>` | `pet-program-3-v1.0` |
| Pet program (named) | `<pet-program>-v<version>` | `the-farm-v1.0` |
| Icon (mood 1 to 9) | `<pet-program>-v<version>-icon-<mood>-v<icon version>` | `pet-program-3-v1.0-icon-2-v1.0.png` |
| Tool box label | `<pet-program>-v<version>-<tool>-v<tool version>` | `pet-program-3-v1.0-notes-tool-v1.0`, `the-farm-v1.0-astras-pet-os-system-map-v1.0`, `pet-program-5-v1.0-harness-strapper-v1.0` |
| Backlog (the store) | `<pet-program>-backlog` | `the-farm-backlog` |
| Backlog entry | `<pet-program>-v<version>-backlog-<YYYYMMDD>-<NNN>` | `the-farm-v1.0-backlog-20261013-001` |
| Weekly backlog run | `<pet-program>-v<version>-backlog-run-<YYYYMMDD>` | `the-farm-v1.0-backlog-run-20261019` |

The backlog store is the one name without a version, on purpose: it belongs to the pet program across every version,
so it is never lost. Every entry and every run inside it carries the version it was written against.
Mood numbers: 1 calm, 2 blink, 3 happy, 4 curious, 5 worried, 6 sad, 7 sick, 8 shocked, 9 asleep.

## 3. The page, top to bottom

Every pet program page is made of tool boxes. Each has a border, its versioned label on the top border, and
everything about that tool inside it.

1. **Icon tool box** (top left): the current mood icon, labelled with its full icon name
   (`pet-program-3-v1.0-icon-2-v1.0`).
2. **Status line** (always visible):
   - **Data:** whose data is showing (the user's handle, never a legal name).
   - **Last entry:** date of the user's last entry.
   - **Updated:** date of this pet program's last update to itself, with its version.
   - **Seat:** whether an AI is in the harness now, which one (Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT, a local model) and its
     task: a tool of this pet program, or a chat, Codex task or project name. It reuses the presence structure of
     `anthropic-discord-presence` and `openai-discord-presence` (app, model, project, task, since). "Seat: empty"
     when no agent is working.
   - **On the map:** a link to the System Map focused on this pet program's own node
     (`…/system-map-20261012.html#node=<node-id>`), where it shows connected to the Friendly Farmer.
3. **Notes tool box** (`<pet-program>-v<version>-notes-tool-v<version>`), near the top: a text box, screenshot upload
   and a **Submit** button. Every submission is saved to the backlog straight away, before anything else happens.
4. **Chat tool box:** a chat bot drawn as the pet program icon. On first visit it asks whether it may use the user's
   own AI subscriptions (Claude, ChatGPT, local models, whatever they have) and remembers the answer on that device;
   the user can change it any time. It signs in through the user's own accounts; no API key is stored in the page.
   Every program uses its exact current pet icon as the chat launcher. Start with a
   shared chat panel using Chip's original yellow phone, green LCD and black outline.
   Header: **[Pet name] Chat**, for example Project Parrot Chat. A cyberdeck redesign is deferred.
   Show actual L3 connection/seat status; a disconnected chat must not fake responses.
5. **The pet program's own tool boxes**, one per tool. Every tool box has:
   - an **ON/OFF** switch (a kill switch): OFF stops the tool at once, for a suspected security breach;
   - a manual **maintenance light** paired with the power light on the **left** of each tool:
     "this tool is broken from my point of view" (it goes to the Farmer's
     `broken-tools-on-the-farm` and to the backlog), with **Take it to the vet-clinic** to ask the community
     (section 10);
   - its version, what it does in one plain line, its links, and how it is used. A Unity Unicorn tool such as
     `harness-strapper` links its download on the title and lists which avatars it is rigged on.
6. **Connection boxes**, one for every other pet this pet program talks to. They use a different border colour from
   tool boxes, and the title on the border is only the other pet's icon name (for example **Log Lynx**). Inside:
   - **Sends:** what this pet program sends to it, and why (for example "status: my health, daily");
   - **Receives:** what it gets back, and why;
   - the other pet program's name and version, small (`pet-program-48-v1.0`), and the scope L4 granted;
   - the last exchange (date and time) and whether it worked;
   - an **ON/OFF** switch for the connection, so a suspected breach can be cut off between two pets without turning
     either one off. The same rules apply as for tools (section 4).
   The flows come from the same relations the System Map draws, so the page and the map always agree.
7. **Links tool box**, grouped by kind (section 5).
8. **Backlog health tool box:** healthy / needs attention / unhealthy, with the L3 agent's diagnosis of what is
   unhealthy, the date of the next weekly run, and the schedule.
9. **Pet Collar tool box** (`<pet-program>-v<version>-pet-collar-v<version>`): its microchip (signature), pedigree
   (where it came from), passport stamps (installs and updates), vaccination card (security patches) and vet records
   (vet-clinic tickets). See [PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md).
10. **Footer:** the coding languages used, from the repo; credit "by Astra" and the license; signature status.

## 4. Tools: ON/OFF and sick, enforced, not just shown

- **Missing programs are not errors** (Astra, 2026-10-14). A pet first checks whether the programs it looks after are on
  this PC. If they are not (a friend without VR software running Rift Rabbit, say), the pet shows **"not on this PC"**
  (the asleep mood, 9) and sends nothing. It never raises errors, alarms or tickets for software that was never
  installed. Developers call this feature detection, or graceful degradation.

- The ON/OFF state lives in the core (the Farm), not in the tool's own storage, so a compromised tool cannot turn
  itself back on. The runtime checks it before the tool runs; the page control only asks the core; a disconnected control must state its local-only scope.
- Anyone on the farm may turn a tool **OFF**. Turning it back **ON** after a security OFF needs L4 approval and is logged.
- **The Farmer's `broken-tools-on-the-farm`** tool box lists every tool marked sick, turned off, or failing its
  health check, across every pet, with which pets use it.

## 5. Link kinds

**Cross-pet link standard (Astra, 2026-10-14):** everywhere a link goes to another
pet program, its visible hyperlink is that pet's current approved icon, not a text
link or a repository URL. Keep surrounding explanatory text and connection-box
titles where useful; only the clickable navigation element is the icon. Give it an
accessible name (for example, "Open Health Hummy — The Nectar Nest"), a tooltip,
keyboard focus styling and a usable hit area without enlarging the pet artwork.
Use the canonical program route and versioned icon asset. Repository/source links
remain explicitly identified as source links; they are not substitutes for programs.
If no program route exists, show a non-clickable icon with "Program not available"
and record the missing route. Do not create a misleading link.

Public icons can be served with existing static app hosting; no separate image host
is required. Keep a packaged local asset for local/offline interfaces. Use a shared
registry mapping stable pet ID to icon and program route rather than copied URLs
throughout the UI. Never expose private/local-only programs through a public URL.

Every link sits in one group and carries three badges, so nobody has to guess what it is.

| Group | What goes there |
|---|---|
| **Home** | Its node on the System Map; The Farm |
| **Source** | Repo, releases (versions), changelog |
| **Tools it hosts: public** | Hosted tool pages anyone can open |
| **Tools it hosts: private** | Tools that open only on this PC (local only) |
| **Third-party it uses (external)** | Programs, libraries, services and AI models made by others |
| **Data it reads or writes** | Local folders and APIs, each with the scope L4 granted |
| **Pets it works with** | Shown as connection boxes (section 3, item 6), not as plain links |
| **Docs** | README, PROTECTION-RINGS.md, this framework (with the version it follows) |

Badges: **who made it** (Astra / third-party) · **where it runs** (this PC / local network / hosted) ·
**who can see it** (public / private).

## 6. Data: never lost, always transferable

- Data lives outside the code, per user and per pet program, not per version:
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\astras-pet-os\<pet-program>\` on the PC (pages that run in a browser keep it in browser storage
  and export to the same folder).
- Every data file records its `schema` version. Every new pet program version ships a **migration**. An update
  installs the new code, copies the old data to a dated backup, then migrates. Nothing is deleted.
- Updates carry the user's data to the new version on their own farm automatically (on Astra's farm: her local
  session). **Export** and **import** (JSON plus images) move data to a new device or version by hand.
- The backlog is medium sized: up to 2,000 entries or 200 MB. Past that, finished entries move to
  `<pet-program>-backlog-archive`, which is kept too.

## 7. The backlog and the weekly run

- Each entry: `id`, `created`, `author` (handle), `kind` (note, screenshot, bug, change request), `tool` (which tool
  box it is about), `text`, `attachments`, `status` (new, queued, in run, done, declined), `run`.
- **Weekly by default.** The L3 agent's scheduled run bundles every new entry, with its screenshots, into the next
  task prompt (`<pet-program>-v<version>-backlog-run-<date>`). Running more often costs more tokens, so it needs L4
  approval.
- After each run the L3 agent updates **backlog health** and says what is unhealthy (stale entries, duplicates,
  entries with no tool, screenshots with no description) and how it will improve as the backlog grows.

## 8. When something breaks: detect, fix, check, approve, roll out

Example: a pet program's link to the System Map is broken.

1. **Detect.** Log Lynx's health checks find the broken link. The Farmer watches Log Lynx's own heartbeat, so a
   silent Log Lynx is noticed too.
2. **Known fix?** If a runbook (an existing protocol) covers it, run it. No AI is needed.
3. **New issue: maker agent.** The L3 agent opens an incident and drafts a fix on a branch, using only allowed pets
   (Platform Platypus, Wifi Butterfly, Log Lynx, …) and only for each tool's declared intended use. Those
   declarations live in the core, where the maker cannot edit them.
4. **Checker agent.** A separate agent with read-only access reviews the proposed change: is it within the
   declared use, within permissions, and does the diff do only what it says? Ideally a different model or
   provider, in its own context, seeing the diff and the rules but not the untrusted input that caused the
   incident. It cannot edit.
5. **L4 approves.** Every security-related change notifies L4, who sees the request and authorizes it or not.
6. **Roll out in stages.** L4's own farm first; other farms pull the signed release; automatic rollback if health
   checks fail.
7. **Record.** Log Lynx writes the incident and the approval to an append-only log. It records approvals; it can
   never create one. L4's approval is the proof, signed with L4's security key once signing is in place.

Two agents that disagree escalate to L4 after two rounds.

## 9. Security patches for every farm

- The framework is versioned (this file's version is in each pet program's `pet.json` as `framework`).
- Patches ship as **signed releases**. Each farm's Friendly Farmer checks for them, verifies the signature,
  quarantines the update, and installs it when that farm's L4 approves. That farm's L4 may opt in to installing
  signed security patches automatically.
- Nobody pushes into another person's farm. Farms pull; GitHub is the only shared place.

## 10. Is your pet sick? The vet-clinic (community help)

Astra's PetOS is meant for anyone to adopt: an open-source personal AI platform that its community keeps healthy,
the way Linux distributions take bug reports and fixes from their users. The **vet-clinic** is where that happens.

- **What it is:** a public issue tracker on GitHub (the only shared place; farms still never connect to each other).
  A farmer whose pet is sick opens a **ticket**; other farmers diagnose it and may offer a **cure** (a code fix,
  as a pull request or patch).
- **Names:** ticket `vet-clinic-ticket-<NNNN>`, titled `<pet-program>-v<version>: <what is wrong>`; a cure is
  `vet-clinic-ticket-<NNNN>-cure-<N>`.
- **Before a ticket is posted** (on the farmer's own PC): only the sick tool's code and the error are attached, never
  private data. name-eraser and the secret scan run first, and the farmer's L4 approves the exact text that goes out.
  Private pets (health, finance, memes, privacy tools) post a description and the error only, never their code.
- **Trust tiers**, highest first. Every answer shows its tier:
  1. **Official:** signed releases from the project's maintainers.
  2. **Kennel-verified:** pets and fixes reviewed and adopted through the Kennel.
  3. **vet-clinic community:** answers and cures from other farmers. **Every one carries a warning:** unverified
     code from someone you do not know. It never runs automatically.
- **Using a cure:** treated like a pet from another farm (the sick cow rule). It goes into quarantine, a checker agent
  reviews it against the ticket, and the farm's L4 approves it before it runs.
- **Everything is logged.** Every ticket, answer and cure stays on GitHub, and Log Lynx keeps the farm's own copy.
  Cures that work for many farms are reviewed by the maintainers and become official patches, so community fixes
  improve the whole platform.
- **Who runs it:** until a professional security engineer joins (when teams begin), the project's maintainer (Astra)
  is the moderator, with a triage pet that labels tickets, checks for leaked secrets, and runs offered cures in an
  isolated test (CI). The triage pet never merges anything.

## 11. Tools, tricks, shared tools and the Shed

Full explanation with four real examples: [TOOLS-AND-TRICKS.md](TOOLS-AND-TRICKS.md).
- A **tool** is code the pet program owns; a **trick** is a skill its L3 agent has learned, shown in a trick box
  (`<pet-program>-v<version>-<trick>-trick-v<trick version>`) with its origin, the tools it uses and ON/OFF.
  A trick never brings permissions of its own. **Skill Scout** keeps track of every trick.
- **Shared tools:** one copy, owned by one pet program; other pets get a **grant** from Iron Gates (folders, R W X,
  limits), approved by L4 and shown in both pets' connection boxes.
- **Third-party tools and tricks** come through **the Shed** (like the Kennel, for tools): quarantine, checker agent,
  L4. Trust tiers: official, Shed-verified, community (with a warning).

## 12. Agent keys, the Police Station and the alarm

Every agent, ours or **external**, needs a **key** to operate a pet. That is how a break-in is caught and traced.

- **Short-lived key per session.** Gatekeeper Goddess (Iron Gates) issues one for each agent session. The key records
  which agent and model, which person, which device and where, which pets and grants, and when it expires.
  No key, no access. A stolen key stops working soon and points back to where it came from.
- **API Fairy shows every key** on the API Fairy Ring, in the `api-fairy-ring-v1.0-api-fairy-mushroom-circle-v1.0`
  tool box: active keys float inside the mushroom circle with a list beside them; expired keys leave the circle and
  go into the chest (old keys), with their own list. Keys themselves are never shown, only who, what, where and when.
- **Pet Police Officer (The Police Station) watches** every W (write) and every key use, live, and looks for
  unpermitted agent changes. It may **switch a tool, connection or key OFF** at once (containment), never ON. It alerts
  Gatekeeper Goddess, so her decisions are not made on tampered ground, and L4.
- **The alarm** when a break is happening now, or a past breach is found: Pet Police Officer jumps onto the desktop
  with a siren, every pet page and the System Map show a red banner, the affected nodes flash on the map, and L4 gets
  a phone notification. A past breach is marked "found, not active".
- **Security jobs, no overlap:** Gatekeeper Goddess decides who may do what and issues keys and grants. Pet Police
  Officer watches, alarms and switches OFF. Log Lynx keeps the records. Forensic Ferret investigates past breaches.
  API Fairy shows the keys. L4 approves.
- **Farmhands:** the AI models that take the seat are farmhands, not pets. Only farmhands on the allowlist get a key,
  and trust is earned in levels ([SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)). A pet program never trusts a farmhand by itself.
- **Shutdown and recovery:** on an alarm, keys are revoked, agents stop and agent network is cut (containment, not a
  crash). Rescue Retriever (The Recovery Room) rebuilds and restarts the farm in the safe order; only L4 turns
  anything back on ([SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).

## 13. The first run: How to Take Care of Your Farm!

When someone first installs Astra's PetOS, it opens straight to the **System Map**.
The Farm has a **tutorial-tools** box with **first-time-here-tutorial**, also presented
as **How to Take Care of Your Farm!**. It can be reopened after the first visit.
Tutorials are always delivered in the pet's **L3 chatbot**. The tutorial tool remains
listed in a tool box on the program page; clicking it opens the pet's chat and starts
that specific tutorial. It is not replaced by a standalone guide page. Its actual
steps remain to be written and tested. The numbered SOP is the agent's guide/trick;
the visible tool is the launcher and tour controls. If L3 is disconnected, open the
chat with an honest connection/setup state, not a simulated active tutorial.

**Tutorial standard (Astra, 2026-10-14):** every pet program provides two simple,
always-numbered standard operating procedures (SOPs):

- **Play with [pet]:** how to use the program for its intended job, from prerequisites
  through one successful result, including what the user should see after each action.
- **Care for [pet]:** setup/connections, updates, routine checks, data backup where
  applicable, and what to do when the program or a tool is not working. This is care
  of the software, not health advice about the user.

Suggested stable tool IDs use the canonical pet ID: `play-with-<pet-id>` and
`care-for-<pet-id>`; friendly display labels can use the pet's full name. Examples
such as "health-hummingbird" do not rename Health Hummy or its stable ID.
Each SOP includes its applicable program/tool version, numbered steps, expected
results and a stop/help path. Unbuilt features stay explicitly planned, not usable steps.
On the program surface show **only the current step number** beside the target and a
soft glow behind/around its background border to identify the focus. Instructions and
questions stay in chat. Use the real rendered element as the target; follow scrolling
and resizing, avoid obscuring controls, and remove the glow when stopped or finished.
Provide Next, Back, Pause/Resume and Exit in chat. A missing target stops advancement
with a clear explanation; do not highlight an unrelated element or claim completion.
Respect reduced motion and provide accessible step/target announcements.

Tutorial tools stay visible in their page tool boxes, with the same **left-side manual
maintenance light** and **separate ON/OFF switch** as other tools. These
controls must not be hidden exclusively inside chat. OFF prevents launch and stops
the active tour/highlight; marking Not working records a defect independently of OFF.
Marking a tutorial complete does not grant permissions or execute its steps.

The Farm indexes tutorials from their owning pets instead of maintaining divergent
copies. Organize tools and tutorials by **pet**, **category** (for example health),
and **nested groups**, with search and multi-category tags. Every tool keeps one
stable identity and owner regardless of how many groups show it. Grouping never
changes permissions or health status. "Health" as a subject category must be distinct
from software-health status such as broken or ready.

**Seeds for you.** With the user's OK, the Friendly Farmer's seed-suggester (a tool of The Farm) reads the names of
the programs installed on the PC, read only and never leaving it, and suggests seeds: pets he can hatch for them, and
pets they could adopt from the Kennel. Every example pet on the map also offers **Make one like this for me**, which
copies a request for the user's own AI to start a seed like it on their farm.

## 14. Checklist for a new or updated pet program

Owner refinement, 2026-10-14: harness seats are model-independent. Do not hard-wire a
pet's chat to one provider; support authorized models through compatible adapters.
Compatibility is not automatic access: an unconnected model cannot claim a seat.

Every Pet Program needs a bordered **Clicker Training** box showing its actual
desktop-icon consecutive-click bindings. Current standard from Astra: one click
shows a short dialog from the pet with its most important message, matching the
active emotion; two clicks toggle ON/OFF (window visibility versus background
execution awaits clarification); three clicks performs
a declared pet-specific quick tool (example: Voicemeeter Bug opens Audio Rescue and
runs voicemeeter-fix). Show each binding and whether implemented, unavailable or
pending. Do not advertise unimplemented actions. Resolve a click sequence once so
triple-click does not accidentally run all three actions; respect system timing and
do not treat dragging as clicking. Extra click counts are unassigned unless declared.
Quick actions use the same permissions, OFF state and appropriate approvals as the
tool's normal launcher. Existing native bindings remain unchanged pending clarification.

**Emotion/message priority:** select the highest-priority unresolved condition,
then derive both the emotion and short dialog from that same condition. Do not use
sprite number or animation order as severity. Existing Farmer self-audit precedence
is owner-needed/sick, then alarmed, then worried, then happy; this is not a complete
global hierarchy for all nine moods. A global priority policy must explicitly cover
active security incidents, execution failures/sad, working/curious, no-data/asleep,
idle and cosmetic blink before runtime rollout. Until resolved, preserve existing
runtime precedence and flag uncertainty. Messages state the condition and next useful
action; stale success must not hide an unresolved failure. Blink never replaces the
underlying status message. Dismissal does not resolve an issue or clear a health report.

Credential inputs have adjacent **(?) What is this** hover/focus help that explains
purpose, whether optional, access scope, storage and destination in plain language.
Never display actual credentials in tooltips or ask for them in chat.

- [ ] Names and versions follow section 2 everywhere: repo, files, icons, tool box labels, backlog.
- [ ] `pet.json` lists `framework`, every tool (name, version, intended use, public or private) and its links by kind.
- [ ] Page has every block in section 3, in that order. Every tool box has ON/OFF and sick; every connection box
      has its own border colour, the other pet's icon name as its title, sends and receives, and ON/OFF.
- [ ] Data is outside the code, with a schema version, a migration, export and import (section 6).
- [ ] Backlog and the weekly run work, and backlog health shows (section 7).
- [ ] The map link focuses its own node. Languages show in the footer.
- [ ] Its tricks are in trick boxes and known to Skill Scout; any shared tool it uses has a grant from Iron Gates.
- [ ] Every agent that operates it uses a short-lived key from Iron Gates; it reports every W to the Police Station.
- [ ] Plain developer language throughout; no marketing.
- [ ] Follows [PROTECTION-RINGS.md](PROTECTION-RINGS.md): it is an animal only once L4 lets it in.

## Current shared presentation standard — 2026-10-15

The October 14 coin, pink-base-theme, hidden-checkbox and horizontally scrolling footer
instructions are retired. Use the original yellow Chip phone with the current pet's
artwork; preserve real chat handlers. Tools use rounded expandable bubbles and the
paired indicator-light controls below, visible even while collapsed. Closing a tool
never disables it. OFF prevents new actions through every launcher and stops the page's
associated polling; native background workers have explicitly separate controls.
Nested tools retain their own stable IDs, independent state and execution gates.

Use `apps/pet-phone-20261015.js`, `apps/pet-paper-20261015.js` and their CSS as the shared
source. `scripts/sync-program-shells-20261015.mjs` updates existing local pet entries;
`node scripts/build-footers-20261014.mjs` updates hub copies. Chip must also be rebuilt
from `dashboard/src.html`. Shared UI does not imply an L3 connection or OS kill switch.

The shared footer has a light background, thin top/bottom rules, centered wrapping
status and signature groups, spaced sparkles, and a static Farmer home icon. All
content stays accessible at mobile width. No coins or horizontal footer scrolling.

### Owner visual standard — 2026-10-15
Every visible text item must sit inside a bubble, card, label plate, or other intentional background; never leave raw copy floating on the stationery. Emotion labels use the normal page text color, set into the rounded speech-bubble border, with the pet on the right. Status and emotion settings need their own surfaces. Keep the portrait sheet fixed in width and let footer groups wrap into spacious, slightly staggered rows between its top and bottom rules. No horizontal footer scrollbar, clipping, or hidden footer links. Verify at desktop and mobile widths; preserve Clicker Training.


### Base structure and application launchers — owner correction 2026-10-15
Order: Third Party Programs, Your Programs, Your Tools, then one shared two-column section with Your Tutorials on the left and Your Notes on the right. Stack that pair on narrow screens. Preserve Clicker Training and About below it. Application rows use square cloud-framed tiles containing actual application icons and names, with one-click launch actions; do not hide launchers behind a disclosure or send an installed-app launcher to a marketing website. Clearly distinguish installers from standalone apps (BetterDiscord opens its verified installer; it is a Discord modification). Launch routes must be fixed and bounded, with visible failure feedback. Verify the real application launch separately from rendering. No invented app integrations. Damsel uses slightly deeper blue wrinkled stationery with purple/light-blue controls and small neon-pink accents; no pink base theme or sharp diagonal folds.


Tool controls standard (2026-10-15): two compact glossy, lightly sparkling status-light buttons stacked together on the left edge of each tool bubble, vertically centered when possible and aligned at the top for expanded content. Keep a fixed 6px gap between the lights; move the pair as one unit. Top: green on / red off. Bottom: blue working / orange owner-marked maintenance. No visible ON or Not Working text. Keep title tooltips, explicit accessible state labels, keyboard focus and reduced-motion support. Both lamps remain usable when collapsed or disabled; maintenance toggles persist and feed existing health reporting. Blue is the manual health flag, not proof of a successful runtime check.


Owner correction, 2026-10-15: cloud-shaped square tiles are for Third Party Programs only. OpenAI and Anthropic presence controllers belong under Your Tools in the regular rounded tool bubbles, with their paired left lights and Discord-style profile-card previews inside. Other owner-created programs use regular program/tool bubbles rather than third-party cloud tiles. Hide an empty Your Programs row.
