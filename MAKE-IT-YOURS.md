# MAKE IT YOURS

Astra's PetOS comes with **Astra's farm as an example**: her pets, her worlds and her pet programs, each wearing an
**EXAMPLE** tag on the System Map. This page shows how to turn it into **your own farm**: your own copy, your own
name, your own pets, and how to delete examples and get them back. Astra, 2026-10-14.

**Choose when you install (Astra, 2026-10-18).** The installer's **Set up your farm** window offers **Set up Your Farm
with Astra's Example Pets** (every example comes along) or **Set up Your Farm From Scratch** (only the **core pets**,
which every farm needs and which cannot be taken away, plus any examples you tick). Run the installer again any time to
change your mind. Choosing changes only your installed copy; the steps below change your own fork.

## The idea in one minute

- You make your own copy of Astra's PetOS on GitHub. Developers call it a **fork**: it is yours, and it stays linked to
  Astra's original (the **upstream**), so updates and security patches can reach you **when you choose**.
- Delete anything you do not want. **Nothing is ever lost:** every example stays online in Astra's repos, and your own
  copy remembers every change you make.
- Your data never goes into your copy. Your pets keep your data on your PC.

## 1. Make your own copy (once)

1. Make a free account at [github.com](https://github.com). A handle is enough; you do not need your real name.
2. Open [github.com/findastra/astras-pet-os](https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-os) and press **Fork**, then
   **Create fork**. You now have `github.com/<you>/astras-pet-os`.
3. Give it your system's name: your fork → **Settings** → **Repository name**, for example `jordans-pet-os`
   (lowercase words joined by hyphens).
4. Install from **your** copy: your fork → **Code** → **Download ZIP**, unzip it, and run the installer
   (see the [README](README.md#beta-testers-and-their-ai-start-here)).

Or ask your AI: *"Help me fork findastra/astras-pet-os, rename it to `<name>`, and install it from my fork with its
installer. Show me each step before you do it."*

## 2. Delete examples

| Where | How | Undo |
|---|---|---|
| **On the System Map** | Click it → **Remove from my map** | **Show removed** brings everything back. This only changes the map in your browser. |
| **From your farm** | In your fork, open `pets.json`, delete that pet's entry (the block with its name), and commit. Then download your fork again and rerun the installer. | Step 3 below |

Or ask your AI: *"Remove the example pet `<name>` from my farm's pets.json. Show me the change first, then commit it to my fork."*

Astra's worlds (Astra's Infinite Pole, Piranesi House) live in their own repos. They are never downloaded with your
farm; on your map they are examples only.

## 3. Get something back

- **From Astra's repo:** every example is always online. Pets: `github.com/findastra/<pet's repo>`. Worlds:
  [astras-infinite-pole](https://github.com/findastra/astras-infinite-pole) and
  [piranesi-house](https://github.com/findastra/piranesi-house). Copy the pet's entry from
  [Astra's pets.json](https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-os/blob/main/pets.json) back into yours.
- **From your own history:** your fork remembers every change. Your fork → **Commits** → open the change that removed
  it → **Revert**. Or ask your AI to revert that commit.

## 4. Get updates and security patches

Your fork → **Sync fork** → **Update branch**, when you want them (look at **Compare** first to see what changes).
Things you deleted stay deleted; new examples Astra adds may appear, and you can delete those too. If GitHub reports a
conflict, ask your AI for help or open a ticket at the [vet-clinic](https://github.com/findastra/vet-clinic).

## 5. Your own pets

- Ask your AI to make a pet for whatever you use: it follows the
  [Pet Program Framework](PET-PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK.md), gives the pet program its own repo (`<you>/<pet-program>`), and
  adds it to your `pets.json`. The Friendly Farmer will do this for you once his spawning tool is built.
- Proud of it? Bring it to [the Kennel](https://github.com/findastra/the-kennel) so other farmers can adopt it.

## 6. Keep it safe

- **A fork of a public repo is public.** Never put keys, passwords or personal information in it. Your pets keep your
  data on your PC, and GitHub's push protection stops most leaked keys.
- Pets with private data (health, money, private notes) belong in **private** repos of their own, not in your public fork.
- Install only with the installer, and only from your own fork or Astra's releases. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

**Words you will see:** *fork* (your own linked copy), *upstream* (Astra's original), *commit* (one saved change),
*revert* (undo a commit), *sync fork* (bring in updates).
