# How the pets relate

*Generated from `relations`, `rounds` and `pipeline` in [pets.json](pets.json) by `npm run build`. Edit pets.json, not this file. The rules behind it are in [PET-FILES.md](PET-FILES.md).*

## How a change is saved

Changes start at the bottom and are saved upward. Nothing generated is edited by hand.

| Level | Who | Owns | Saves by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Astra** | Approvals: new art (it costs money), a pet's job, anything in a card waiting on her | Answering a card, or telling an assistant |
| 2 | **Friendly Farmer** (`astras-pet-os`) | `pets.json`: who exists, kinds, art, relations, the mood key | His daily round, and assistants working on the Cage |
| 3 | **Each pet's repo** | Its own app, README, cards, and its own name, job, status, bubble lines, mood lines and audit | Editing its `pet.json`, and submitting identity changes in `cage.submit` |
| 4 | **Generated** | `cage-data.js`, `ROSTER.md`, the README table, the Farmer's desk, `MOOD-KEY.md`, this file, `status/pets-status.json`, the profile's pet list | Never by hand: the build and the rounds rewrite them |

## Who tells whom

Thick arrows work today. Plain arrows are planned (in a plan or a card). Dotted arrows are ideas nobody has agreed to yet. A name with * is in the pipeline: on GitHub, not registered in the Cage yet.

### What travels

| Kind | Means |
|---|---|
| `registry` | who exists, and each pet's name, job, status, moods and lines |
| `status` | a pet's mood and its one-line bubble |
| `findings` | problems found by an audit |
| `card` | a task left in a handoffs/ folder |
| `keys` | which API keys a pet uses (never the key itself) |
| `idea` | a project idea |
| `shipped` | what changed: new repos, new pets, status changes |
| `cue` | a live trigger: a scene, a beat, a button |
| `art` | drawings and mood frames |

### Every link

### Private pets

Health Hummy, Finance Finch, Meme Fiend *. These pets' data never leaves the PC. Other pets do not read from them, and the self-audit checks only their repo files.

### On their own so far

Python Panther, Astra Wisp, Patty, Voicemeeter Bug, Platform Platypus, Sugarcube *, Patch Cat *, Fuzzboi Friend *, Role Fairy *. Every pet still submits to the Farmer and audits itself; these have no links to other pets yet.
