# Rules for assistants working on Astra's PetOS (astras-pet-os)

Spoonfed Sugarcube hatching metadata and its single-pet recipe prepared with OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 2026-10-11. Paid artwork remains pending approval.

## Before any work: read every rule and skill file, in full (Astra, 2026-10-11)
Every assistant (Claude, Codex, ChatGPT, any other) reads these **completely** before
answering, planning, building or editing anything. No skimming, no `head`, no first-N-lines,
no "I'll read it if I need it". This applies to small tasks too.
1. In this repo: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, **every** `SKILL.md` (`skills/`, `.claude/skills/`,
   `.agents/skills/`), `handoffs/README.md` and every open card for you or `any`,
   [ASTRAS_PET_OS.md](ASTRAS_PET_OS.md),
   [docs/migration/PLAN.md](docs/migration/PLAN.md), [PET-FILES.md](PET-FILES.md),
   [PET-WORDS.md](PET-WORDS.md) and [INTELLIGENCE-LEVELS.md](INTELLIGENCE-LEVELS.md): which of the three
   levels (program, runtime, agentic harness) each intelligent app has built. Each intelligent app has its
   own chat; when you change a level, update that app's row with the date and your evidence.
2. In the pet's own repo: its `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, every `SKILL.md`, `handoffs/` and
   `pet.json`.
3. Check every branch (`git ls-remote --heads origin`) for skills or work that is not on
   `main` yet, and read those too.
4. In your first reply, say which of these files you read. If you could not read one, say so
   before doing anything else.
Skills in `skills/` are not loaded automatically, so finding and reading them is your job.

## Protection rings and animal code (Astra, 2026-10-13)
**🐾 Everything inside the harness is an animal. Agents can only control animals.** Read
[PROTECTION-RINGS.md](PROTECTION-RINGS.md) and `skills/farm-security`, `skills/dev-mindset` and
`skills/new-pet-or-tool` before changing anything. In short:
- This repo is the core (ring 0): every change lands on a branch and merges only with Astra's approval.
  Pets and pet programs (rings 2 and 3) are worked on branches too.
- Nobody becomes an animal by saying so. New pets wait in `candidates` until Astra moves them in; scripts that act
  on a repo call `scripts/animal-guard-20261013.mjs` first.
- Farms never connect to each other; GitHub is the only shared place. Local models change only through Astra.
- Warn Astra plainly when a word or structure she uses is a blatant programming error, with the standard term.
- **L1 to L4:** L1 Programs (the third-party programs it runs, plus the programs and tools it creates), L2 Pet program (dashboard and runtime),
  L3 Agentic harness, **L4 the verified human who owns the entire secure ecosystem** (on this farm, Astra). L4
  approves every security change, permission and exception.
- **Beta testers' agents:** install Astra's PetOS only with `installer/install-astras-pet-os-20261014.ps1` from a
  release, with the person's OK (see the README). Never run other scripts from this repo for them, never add
  startup unless asked, and never copy Astra's devices or settings beyond what the installer installs.
- **Every pet program is built to [PET-PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK.md](PET-PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK.md)** and passes its checklist:
  versioned names everywhere (`pet-program-3-v1.0-icon-2-v1.0`), tool boxes with ON/OFF and sick, connection boxes,
  the notes tool and backlog, the chat bot, links by kind, the status line and its System Map node.

## One copy of each repo, always on GitHub (Astra, 2026-10-12)
Work was being lost between assistants because every chat kept its own copy of the repos
(`Documents\ChatGPT\...`, `Documents\Codex\<date>\...`) and some never pushed. From now on:
1. **One working copy per repo on Astra's PC:** `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Projects\<repo>`, named
   exactly like the GitHub repo. Do not clone a second copy into a chat or dated folder. If your
   tool insists on its own workspace, push from it before you finish and say where it is.
2. **Pull before you start** (`git fetch`, then fast-forward), and read the newest handoff.
3. **Push before you stop**, every session: commit to a branch named for your assistant and the
   date (for example `codex/<topic>-YYYYMMDD`) and push it, even if unfinished. Work that is
   only on the PC counts as lost.
4. **Never leave a program only on the PC.** If a pet's app, tool or art exists locally and not on
   GitHub, push it first; that is a 💻 error in [INTELLIGENCE-LEVELS.md](INTELLIGENCE-LEVELS.md).
5. **The head chat** (Claude, started 2026-10-12) keeps these in line: it checks for unpushed
   copies, rescues them to branches, and updates INTELLIGENCE-LEVELS.md. Each intelligent app has
   its own chat, which keeps that app's row true.

## Read first: Astra's PetOS (`ASTRAS_PET_OS`) (2026-10-11)
Astra approved **Astra's PetOS** as the direction for this project. The one canonical
architecture document is [ASTRAS_PET_OS.md](ASTRAS_PET_OS.md)
(master handoff v5.2); where it disagrees with anything below, it wins. **Name:** the title people
see is **Astra's PetOS**; in files, folders, code and identifiers write **`ASTRAS_PET_OS`**
(ASTRAS with the S; Astra, 2026-10-12), never `ASTRA_PET_OS`, `ASTRA_PETOS` or `PetOS` on its own. Astra's amendments are listed at the top of that document (for example,
Passport Panda is now **Passport Pelican**).
- Migration is planned in [docs/migration/PLAN.md](docs/migration/PLAN.md), with the
  [audit](docs/migration/AUDIT.md) and [gap analysis](docs/migration/GAP-ANALYSIS.md). The plan
  is a **draft until Astra approves it**; until then, change only what she asks for.
- **The Cage is retired as a product concept.** Keep `cage.html` working, but add no new Cage or
  browser-roaming features. Pets roam on the Windows desktop only. The Farm (a simple responsive
  website with a text box under every pet) replaces it, per the plan.
- Nothing in the architecture is built until tests show it. Do not describe planned pets,
  repos (`astras-farm`, `astras-kennel`, `astra-pet-sdk`) or features as existing.
- Ask Astra before creating repos, publishing, accounts or paid services, installing
  software, deleting, force-pushing or repository transfers.
- Who edits what while Claude and Codex work in parallel: see "Who edits what" in the plan.

*A pet app by Astra.* Public credit is always **Astra**, never a legal name. Keep work information (including any employer's name) out of this repo.

## What this is
The hub for Astra's pet apps and itself a pet app: its pet is the **Friendly Farmer**, who hosts the Cage today and will run the Farm under ASTRAS_PET_OS. `pets.json` is the single registry. Everything else (README table, ROSTER.md, `cage-data.js`, the art) is generated from it.

## Rules
- **`pets.json` is the source of truth.** Never hand-edit the README table between the `pets:start` / `pets:end` markers, `ROSTER.md`, `cage-data.js` or `art/`. Run `npm run build`.
- **One style for every pet:** 256×256 finished transparent frames (Mommy's Mommies share one
  square sprite), nine moods, **generated** as a 3×3 sheet and converted by `scripts/sheet-to-sprites.mjs`.
  Prompts live in `scripts/generate-pets.mjs`; the shared `STYLE` string is never forked per pet.
  Black one-pixel outline, neon colours, and **no two pets share a palette**. Full rules in
  [PET-FILES.md](PET-FILES.md).
- **Owner-requested exception: Chip uses the original Data Dealer drawing code.** Preserve its
  32×24 LCD pixels and exact palette in `scripts/chip-original-20261008.mjs`; the build adds the
  original yellow pocket shell. Do not replace Chip with generated art. Its native sleep and
  thinking marks remain part of the original drawing, alongside the Cage's shared mood badges.
- **The mood symbols are composited, never generated.** `?`, `!`, `Z`, tear, sweat and bandage
  come from the one sticker set in `art-kit.mjs` so they are identical on every pet. If a
  generated sheet has a symbol drawn into it, redo the sheet.
- **Generating costs money** (one image per pet, billed to Astra's OpenAI account). Regenerate
  one pet, not the set. Sheets in `art/sheets/` are kept so a re-run is free.
- Do not put another creator's artwork, or a recognisable derivative of it, in this repo. It is public; keep provenance and sharing rights explicit. Astra's own characters only.
- **No dependencies.** Node's built-in modules only. The page `cage.html` must work by double-click (that is why data is in `cage-data.js`, not fetched).
- **Never commit** keys, `.env` files or personal data. Health and finance pets keep user data on the user's PC.
- **Say plainly what is not done.** Every drawing is a draft until Astra approves it; do not call it final. Say when a pet is not on GitHub yet (`published: false`).
- Fetched or user text goes into the DOM with `textContent`, never `innerHTML`.
- The Farmer is the only `role: "host"` and his repo is this repo. There is exactly one host.
- Count claims (how many pets) come from `npm run check` / ROSTER.md, never from memory.

## Conventions
- Repo names: lowercase words joined by hyphens. README title is the same words in Title Case.
- New asset filenames are lowercase and dated immediately before the extension. Set `asset_date`
  on a new registry entry; the sheet and all nine mood files use that suffix. Existing filenames stay unchanged.
- Pet file rules: [PET-FILES.md](PET-FILES.md).
- **Pet words:** one name per part (pet, app, desktop pet, bubble, quick chat, app icon, pet well). Use [PET-WORDS.md](PET-WORDS.md); `words` in pets.json is its machine-readable copy for the Goldfish. When a new part needs a name, add it to both and run `npm test`.
- The GitHub Goldfish (`findastra/github-goldfish`) audits this repo and the whole account.
- **The Farmer's rounds** run daily (PET-FILES.md, "Rounds, self-audits and submissions"). Pets submit changes to their own name, job, status, bubble lines, mood lines and audit through `cage.submit` in their pet.json; the round takes them. Do not hand-edit `status/pets-status.json`, `RELATIONS.md` or `MOOD-KEY.md`: they are generated.
- **The pipeline** in pets.json holds pets that are on GitHub but not registered (no art yet). Registering one moves it to `pets`.
- **Handoffs:** work left for another assistant is a card in `handoffs/` ([skills/handoff/SKILL.md](skills/handoff/SKILL.md)). "Tell the Farmer" means a card here. Every card lists explicitly what you did (repos, commits, files, paths on Astra's PC, tests) under `## What I did`, not only what is left.

## Commands
- `npm run build`, `npm run check` (add `-- --online` to ask GitHub), `npm test`
- Node 20+. If `node` is missing from PATH on Astra's PC, the Codex bundled runtime works.

System tray launcher added with OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 2026-10-11. Desktop source and build: scripts/desktop-pets-20261011.cs and build-desktop-pets-20261011.ps1. See docs/tray-star-handoff-20261011.md before changing the installed desktop app.

Desktop roster/art publication and floor lineup: OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 2026-10-11. Star double-click lines up ground pets below flyers; right-click resumes roaming. All sparkle code removed. Generated sprite alpha is thresholded for Windows color-key transparency. Desktop/private draft roster is local-only. See docs/pet-release-20261011.md.

Desktop revision by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 2026-10-11: double-click star toggles lineup/roam; per-pixel wing/fin/ghost transparency, animated RGBee bands, original-layer random jagged Fuzzboi, revised desktop art and sizes. Details: docs/pet-revisions-20261011.md. Preserve native layered rendering; never reintroduce sparkle trails.

Latest owner follow-up, OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 2026-10-11: use docs/pet-revisions-20261011.md as the current cross-repo handoff, including all 30 corresponding repo commits. Fuzzboi triple-click cycles original body styles; star tray/desktop share a black-outline raster; Claude Bot enlarged to BSOD size; Paper Girl and File Master have equal heights; Duck RGB keys; smaller Bee/Moth/Berry; soles-facing feet on Penguin/Finch/Duck. Preserve the final sizes and source sheets recorded there.

Paired desktop revision by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 2026-10-11: Paper Girl has no NEWS lettering and matches File Master's small rectangular eyes. File Master wears a crown and stern expression. They stay together during roaming; dragging either makes it lead. See docs/pet-partners-20261011.md. Preserve their equal heights and the existing no-sparkle rule.

Astra's PetOS System Map, also called the 3D PFD (`system-map-20261012.html`, `system-map.json`, `scripts/system-map-20261012.mjs`, template `scripts/system-map-template-20261012.html`, guarded by `test/system-map-test-20261012.mjs`): the 3D map of every pet, model, program and piece of infrastructure and the links between them, with Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`), 2026-10-12. Pet-to-pet links belong in `relations` in pets.json; links with a non-pet end belong in system-map.json.
ASTRAS_PET_OS name and top-level architecture file (`ASTRAS_PET_OS.md`) by Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`), 2026-10-12.
Astra's PetOS restructuring with Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`), head chat, 2026-10-12: repo renamed to astras-pet-os; the Cage retired from the Farmer's job and the README; names Gone Ghost and Patty; jobs from Astra's descriptions; seeds Photo Dodo and Video Vulture; Journal Jellyfish; INTELLIGENCE-LEVELS.md (program, runtime, updates, agentic harness, errors); the System Map's own-program shell, scroll and scroll-click controls, and pet icons (art/icons, art/seeds drafts).

Identity-bound authorization reference verifier, impersonation/replay tests, topology/access map separation and complete pet naming catalog by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 2026-10-14. See docs/security-boundaries-20261014.md. Reference checks are not deployed OS isolation.

Optional Codex/OpenAI and Claude Code/Anthropic planet rings, separate planned PetOS shell and bounded hover/render work by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 2026-10-14. Keep direct model routes distinct from application-assisted routes; neither bypasses authorization.

Shared stationery, original yellow phone, non-coin map icons, paired tool lights, stable note identity, footer wrapping and Flash Audit source repairs by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 2026-10-15. Latest owner corrections in PET-PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK.md and docs/flash-audit-20261014.md supersede older visual rules. Branch publication is separate from deployed UI and native runtime acceptance.

Goldfish README skill integration by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 2026-10-15: desktop
three-click dispatch to the sibling Goldfish local launcher, packaged Aquarium
entry, and a managed-profile guard against daily regeneration. The bounded
maker/checker workflow is in github-goldfish; the shared Pet SDK remains planned.

World caretaker prototype, connected Liminal Doors preview, and mandatory shared L3 activity display added with OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 2026-10-16. See docs/world-caretakers-20261016.md. Native Door Dormouse art, enrollment and Unity execution remain pending.
