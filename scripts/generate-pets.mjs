//
// --match is the safe way to redo a pet whose art is approved. A plain regeneration re-rolls
// the character and the body comes back different (this is how the penguin got slimmer once).
// --match keeps a copy of the pet's current sheet and feeds it back as the reference image, so
// the model redraws the expressions around the body that already exists.
//
// Each pet costs one image. Sheets already on disk are skipped, so this is safe to re-run
// after a failure. It stops on the first billing or rate-limit error rather than burning
// through the rest of the list.
//
// Needs the image bridge (../image-bridge/imagine.mjs) and OPENAI_API_KEY. Override the
// bridge location with IMAGE_BRIDGE=/path/to/imagine.mjs.
