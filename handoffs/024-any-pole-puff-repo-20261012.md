## Why this card exists
Astra asked a Claude chat (2026-10-11) to generate Pole Puff, the Pet and its Pet Program, and check the Friendly
Farmer's repo for instructions. That Claude account is being closed (2026-10-12), so everything from
that chat is written here and in `drafts/pole-puff/`. Nothing is left only in the chat.

## What I did
Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`), 2026-10-11 to 2026-10-12:
- Read in full: this repo's `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `skills/handoff/SKILL.md` on `main`, plus the
  differences on every other branch (all older copies; nothing newer than `main`),
  `ASTRAS_PET_OS.md`, `docs/migration/PLAN.md`, `PET-FILES.md`, `handoffs/README.md`,
  cards 001, 002 and 007; and `findastra/deck-duck`'s AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README, pet.json and
  sprite.json (used as the template for a placeholder pet).
- Asked Astra four questions on 2026-10-11. Her answers:
  1. **Home:** its own new public repo, `findastra/pole-puff`.
  2. **Job:** "placeholder, decide later". *Superseded on 2026-10-12:* the plan and the `seeds` entry
     now say Pole Puff **manages Astra's Infinite Pole** and works with Unity Unicorn. The draft uses that.
  3. **Art:** do **not** generate yet (paid). A free hand-drawn stand-in was made instead.
  4. **Kind:** a **puffball sprite that floats** (`kind: "sprite"`, sky zone).
- Wrote the whole Pet and Pet Program and put it in this repo at **`drafts/pole-puff/`**, branch
  `claude/pole-puff-draft-20261012` (not `main`). The files: `pet.json` (with an audit block),
  `sprite.json`, `index.html` (the pet floating, nine mood buttons, bubble lines set with
  `textContent`), `README.md` (how to run it, Limits), `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT,
  findastra), `.gitignore`, `scripts/draw-pole-puff-20261011.mjs` (stand-in art, Node built-ins
  only), `art/frames/<mood>-20261011.png` (nine moods, 256×256) and `art/sheets/pole-puff-20261011.png`.
  I looked at the sheet: one periwinkle puff with a coral-and-white striped pole tuft and a lime knob,
  nine readable faces.
- In `pets.json`: added `draft`, `kind` and `kind_note` to Pole Puff's **seed** entry. I did **not**
  add a pipeline entry, because there is no repo yet. Added this card and its row in `handoffs/README.md`,
  and a line to AGENTS.md. Ran `npm run build` and `npm test` (results are in the commit message).
- **Not done:** the `findastra/pole-puff` repo was **not created** (the rules say ask Astra first, and
  this session could not create repos). No art was generated or billed. Nothing on Astra's PC was touched.
- Earlier, a draft of this work (a pipeline entry and a card numbered 009) existed only in the chat
  workspace. Codex has since used 009 for Spoonfed Sugarcube, so this card is 010 and that draft was dropped.
- Other things that chat created or relied on: a one-time scheduled task "Resume Pole Puff build"
  (2026-10-11, already fired; nothing to recreate). No artifacts and no connectors. GitHub access went
  through the session's own GitHub link.

## Decisions (Astra answered "YES YES YES" on 2026-10-12, 16:47 MT, to all three below)
1. OK to create `findastra/pole-puff` (public, topic `pet-app`)?
2. OK to generate Pole Puff's art (one image, billed to her OpenAI account)?
3. Is the stand-in look right (periwinkle puff, striped pole tuft, lime knob)?

## Task (in order, after Astra's OK for each step)
1. Create `findastra/pole-puff`, public, topic `pet-app`. Copy `drafts/pole-puff/` in as its first
   commit. Then delete `drafts/pole-puff/` here in the same PR that moves the seed to the pipeline.
2. Move Pole Puff from `seeds` to `pipeline` in `pets.json` (`repo: "pole-puff"`, job from the seed,
   `added`, `audit` from its pet.json). Add the Unity Unicorn link to `relations`, as the seed's
   `works_with` says.
3. With art approved, add to `PETS` in `scripts/generate-pets.mjs` in the same commit as the `pets` entry:
   ```js
   { id: 'pole-puff', what: 'a round fluffy floating puffball creature with a scalloped fluffy edge, two tiny nub arms and no legs, with a short candy-striped pole sticking up from the top of its head like a tuft, topped by a small round knob, no props and no lettering', colours: 'neon periwinkle-blue fluff, hot coral and white candy stripes on the pole tuft, acid-lime knob and nub arms' },
   ```
   Generate, `npm run build`, look at `art/roster.png`, `npm run check`, `npm test`.
4. Build the real job: what "manages Astra's Infinite Pole" means. Ask Astra (for example, tracking
   world uploads, builds or to-dos), then plan it as a PetOS pet (PLAN.md phases). No new Cage features.

## Done when
`findastra/pole-puff` exists with these files, Pole Puff is in the pipeline, and `drafts/pole-puff/` is gone.

## Return
Work on a branch, open a PR, set this card to `status: done`, and update `## What I did`.

## Update, 2026-10-18 (Claude Opus 5.5): brought to `main`
The old branch (`claude/pole-puff-draft-20261012`, PR #8) was on the history from before the 2026-10-13 rewrite, so it
could never merge. Astra asked for it to be rewritten and merged (2026-10-18). Done in one pull request from `main`:
- `drafts/pole-puff/` copied unchanged from PR #8 (commit `23a27a6`), except `README.md` and `pet.json`, which now
  point at `astras-pet-os`, this card (024) and the program name **Infinite Studio** (`pet-programs.json` #38).
- This card renamed 010 → 018 → **024** (handoffs/README.md, "Card numbers on every branch"); paths updated.
- The seed in `pets.json` gets `draft` and `kind` back (`kind: "sprite"`, Astra 2026-10-11).
- PR #8 closed as replaced. Still **not done**: Task steps 1 to 4 (the repo, the pipeline entry, the art, the job).

## Update, 2026-10-12 (Claude Opus 5.5)
Astra approved all three. This Claude session could not create the repo (GitHub sessions here are
limited to existing repos) and cannot generate art (the image bridge runs on Astra's PC with her
OpenAI key). The next assistant: start at Task step 1, no need to ask again.
