Once `findastra/claude-bot` exists on GitHub, run the GitHub Goldfish over it and the
hub. Report missing pet files, a missing `pet-app` topic, and registry mismatches.

## Done when
Findings are written to `handoffs/results/003-goldfish-claude-bot.md`, with the model
name and version at the top.

## Return
Commit on a branch and set `status: done`. Write a new card for each fix it needs.
