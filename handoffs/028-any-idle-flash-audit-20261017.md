## What I did

Astra, 2026-10-17 03:24, before bed: "do the flash audit and prep all the links etc. and fix blatant errors that
don't require my decision, all night long … get the flash audit cards better prepped for me … try to get rid of
Astra's Pet Apps and turn it all into Astra's PetOS (I don't like the hyperlink patch method)." Then, about 04:00:
"make sure you start a repo for every pet that exists … generate them via the Idle Flash Audit … also write down how
to do an idle flash audit."

Newer than one of my own earlier instructions: card 020 says Astra made Role Fairy a pet again on 2026-10-17
(program Fairy Ring, #83), which overrides her 2026-10-09 "the Role Fairy needs to go away". Role Fairy got its pet
files.

**The audit.** Programs 3 to 83 (rounds 1 and 2 were done with Codex on 2026-10-14), read-only through the GitHub API,
with Goldfish's preflight. Then each repo again on its fix branch, so every round card shows what a merge fixes and
what is left. Round cards, in the owner-round format: [docs/flash-audit-rounds-20261017/](../docs/flash-audit-rounds-20261017/README.md).
Answer sheet for the iPad (private to Astra; every tap saves where the next assistant reads it):
<https://claude.ai/artifact/W6FMZthEzhj9EWxBgggCyc>.

**Fixed, each on branch `claude/flash-audit-fixes-20261017` with one pull request per repo (78 PRs, none merged).**
The list of links is in the round cards' index.
- Retired names in documents: `Astra's Pet Apps` -> `Astra's PetOS`, `astras-pet-apps` / `findastra-pet-apps` ->
  `astras-pet-os`, `Documents\Projects` -> `Documents\Astra's PetOS`. Never in code, inside `<script>`, in file names
  or on history lines.
- `pet.json` caught up with the registry and `pet-programs.json` (job, audit block; pet name for Patty and Gone
  Ghost). Not where a pet had submitted its own job (The Astral Plane, Mail Snail, Raspberry Pi Berry, Voicemeeter
  Bug): those are decisions.
- Missing `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and MIT `LICENSE` (public pet repos; not on the art-only Spoonfed repo); Role
  Fairy's `pet.json` from its registry entry (card 020 item 2).
- README credit line, Limits (from INTELLIGENCE-LEVELS.md), and "Run it" / "Limits" in the 41 seed and roadmap repos.
- Eight pipeline pets' READMEs no longer say they wait on card 008 (an old dropped draft, hub PR #5).
- Topic `pet-app` added to learn-python, claude-bot, rgbee and role-fairy (repo settings).

**In this repo.**
- Hub PR #49 (`claude/petos-name-20261017`): Astra's PetOS in the hub's own names; `build-interfaces` crashed on main
  (it looked the Farmer up as `astras-pet-apps`), fixed, and the Farmer's desk rebuilt. Kept on purpose: the desk's
  file name, browser storage keys, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\astras-pet-apps`, compiled C# text (they need the desktop rebuild).
- Hub PR #51, this branch (`claude/idle-flash-audit-20261017`): the how-to ([idle-flash-audit-20261017.md](../docs/idle-flash-audit-20261017.md)),
  the tools (`scripts/idle-flash-*-20261017.mjs`), the round cards and evidence ledger, `repo_exists` corrected for
  43 programs in `pet-programs.json`, and two additions to the Flash Audit: **A57 Current names only** (tier 2, after
  A56) and, in **A13**, "every named pet has a repo; the audit starts one".
- Merge note: the card-table conflict with #50 was fixed on 2026-10-18 after #50 merged (main's table kept; this card's row added).

**Every pet has a repo now (83 of 83).** 41 seed and roadmap repos were already started on 2026-10-14 (public), but the
catalog still said they did not exist. The two that had none were started tonight in the same shape:
[pet-program-81](https://github.com/findastra/pet-program-81) (Intel Owl) and [the-threshold](https://github.com/findastra/the-threshold)
(Door Dormouse). **They are private:** the overnight permission check would not create public repos.

**Folder rename: tried, not done.** File Master's plan row (`file-master\reports\2026-10-17_rename-astras-petos`) was
approved by Astra at 02:40. At about 04:15 nothing ran from the folder and no chat was working there, so I ran
`rename-petos-folder-20261017.ps1 -Apply` (in that plan folder): Windows said the folder was in use, and the script
put everything back (the PetOS junction, live sync). Most likely the Claude app itself holds it through the chats
opened there. To finish, with the Claude app and Codex closed, in PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\Astra's Pet Apps\file-master\reports\2026-10-17_rename-astras-petos\rename-petos-folder-20261017.ps1" -Apply
```

It renames the real folder, leaves a hidden `Astra's Pet Apps` junction so chats opened in the old folder still open
(delete it once those are closed), repoints the Run key, the startup launcher and shortcuts, repairs git worktrees,
copies Claude's memory to the new path and restarts live sync. Malwarebytes' allow-list entry for `api-fairy\bin`
is Astra's to update.

**Found, not changed (decisions on the answer sheet).**
- **Spoonfed is public** on GitHub; the registry and its provenance file say it is a private, artwork-only repo.
- Codex's shared page framework (A41, A44, A45, A52) is on unmerged Codex branches with no pull requests.
- Four pets submitted jobs the registry never took; hub PR #46 fixes the Farmer's round that should take them.
- Old hub PRs #1, #3, #4 and #5 look superseded.
- Data Dealer's program route is a claude.ai artifact behind a sign-in; Discord Damsel's route is a repo page.
- About 42 program names, one pet name (#77) and Role Fairy's art (costs money).

**Not verified overnight:** anything that needs clicking, a desktop launch, a sign-in or a person (A11, A19, A22, A37,
A40, routes behind a sign-in). The desktop pets were not running (the PC restarted about 02:47); I did not start them.
A53 on the PC: `.claude` and `workflow-whirlpool` have no folder icon; Startup Star's shortcut uses the Windows star
(by design).

Other sessions: Skill Scout (hub PR #50, card 027) finished while I worked; nothing of theirs was touched. Working
copies in `Documents\Astra's Pet Apps` were not edited (fresh clones in the temp folder only), except the File Master
plan note and the rename script added to its git-ignored `reports` folder.

**Done, checked overnight 2026-10-18 by Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`):** all 78 fix pull requests on `claude/flash-audit-fixes-20261017` are merged; Astra answered the sheet and hub PR #75 applied the answers (seed repos renamed, jobs, Spoonfed public, Data Dealer's public route, Role Fairy); the Codex branches and conflicts that remain are card 035.

## Task

Answer the sheet, then, for whoever picks this up:
1. Read the answers: `ArtifactData` `list` of collection `answers` at <https://claude.ai/artifact/W6FMZthEzhj9EWxBgggCyc>.
2. Do what they say: merge the fix PRs she OKs, apply chosen names through `pet-programs.json` (and rename repos to
   match), change visibility only where she said so.
3. Re-run the Idle Flash Audit for anything that changed, and record the result in the next card.

## Done when

The answers are applied, the fix PRs are merged or closed, and the folder is renamed.

## Return

Record what was applied and what is still open in the next dated card; set this one to `done`.
