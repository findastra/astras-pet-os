status: open (waiting on Astra: approval for one paid nine-mood Sugarcube sheet)

## What I did

- In `%USERPROFILE%/Documents/ChatGPT/Spoonfed`, added `pet.json`, `pet-sprite-20261011.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `LICENSE`, and `docs/sugarcube-hatching-20261011.md`; edited `README.md` with pet credit, running instructions, and limits. The app is the existing Expo restaurant-discovery draft; its pet is Sugarcube.
- In `%USERPROFILE%/Documents/Projects/findastra-pet-apps`, edited `pets.json` to add an unpublished hatching pipeline entry, `AGENTS.md` to record authorship, and `handoffs/README.md`; added this card. The recipe is staged at `%USERPROFILE%/Documents/ChatGPT/Spoonfed/docs/sugarcube-art-recipe-20261011.json`; the active generator was restored after its contract test correctly rejected a recipe without a registered resident.
- No commits, pushes, new repositories, topic changes, paid image calls, or pet installations. Existing dirty desktop/tray work in the hub was preserved. These changes are local working-tree changes, not a merged or published release.
- The sprite manifest has no frames. Sugarcube is not yet a drawn hub resident or visible in Spoonfed. Do not claim otherwise.
- Ran `node scripts/build.mjs --metadata-only` to regenerate existing hub registry/docs without generating artwork; `node scripts/check-pets.mjs` passed. Ran all 62 hub tests, corrected the staged-recipe placement, and reran the suite. Validated Spoonfed pet metadata and real entry/manifest/home paths with Node. An independent Spoonfed typecheck still hits the previously unresolved TypeScript compiler stack overflow; this preparation does not claim to repair or finish the original app QA.

## Task

After Astra approves the single paid generation, register Sugarcube with art ID `spoonfed-sugarcube` and `asset_date: 20261011`, moving it from pipeline to pets. Use the shared generator style unchanged. Generate only this pet, convert and inspect all nine frames, and use the shared mood stickers. Use the local Spoonfed app as the destination; establish a valid hub app link without claiming a nonexistent live service.

Copy approved frames into Spoonfed’s dated `pet-art/` assets and fill `pet-sprite-20261011.json`. Add a square pet well and wire the moods to real discovery state per the local character brief. All food information is still demo data.

## Done when

One approved character has nine usable transparent 256px moods; Spoonfed visibly uses it; hub build/check/tests pass; and publication status is accurate. Obtain Astra’s OK before creating any GitHub repo or pushing to main.

## Return

Record exact changed paths, validation, commits, and live/local state here. Set done only when the integration is actually complete.

2026-10-11 publication update: Sugarcube art is now published in private findastra/spoonfed (see docs/pet-release-20261011.md). Paid-generation approval wait above is obsolete. Desktop local draft loader now previews Sugarcube; permanent shared registry registration remains separate.
