## What I did

Astra asked me to bring what an older Claude chat (2026-10-07 to 2026-10-08, "the Cage chat") decided into this repo, and to take the best approach. I read the repo's rule files, compared them with `origin/main`, and found that almost everything from that chat is already here or was replaced by newer decisions.

- Branch `claude/chat-sync-20261017`, from `origin/main` at `beed649`, made in a separate worktree so the Codex checkout on `codex/world-caretakers-20261016` was not touched. Not merged.
- Changed `docs/agent-account-20261014.md`: the `icacls` grant pointed at `Documents\Projects`, a folder that no longer exists; it now points at `Documents\Astra's PetOS`, the folder name Astra chose on 2026-10-17 (commit `beed649`).
- Added this card and its row in `handoffs/README.md`.
- Ran `npm test` in the worktree (result recorded below).
- **Astra answered later the same day (2026-10-17):** Role Fairy is a pet and its pet program is **Fairy Ring**; Nullbot is dropped. Done on the same branch: Role Fairy is #83 in `pet-programs.json` (stage `pipeline`, repo `role-fairy`), has a `pipeline` entry in `pets.json`, a measured code list in `system-map.json` (JavaScript 100%, from GitHub), and is no longer in `profile.hidden`; Nullbot's hand-drawn code was removed from `scripts/pets-art.mjs` and from its `PETS` list; `npm run build` regenerated the derived files; all 89 tests pass. Note: "Fairy Ring" sits next to API Fairy's "API Fairy Ring"; the name-list test accepts it, but Astra may want to tell them apart. Workflow Whale's suggested number (#83 in the naming audit) is now taken, so it would be #84.
- Updated my own memory notes outside the repo. Nothing else on Astra's PC was changed. `git fetch` only in every other repo.

**Already on main, nothing to do:** the registry and nine moods; Goldfish, Chip, API Fairy, Unity Unicorn, Python Panther, Astra Wisp, Health Hummy, Finance Finch, Mommy's Mommies (the twins share one sprite), Patty, File Master, Discord Damsel; the employer-name rule; the one-working-copy rule with the new folder name.

**Superseded, deliberately not carried over:** the Cage features asked for in the old chat (the Farmer opening the cage door, Nullbot standing on the cage, browser roaming), because the Cage is retired (Astra, 2026-10-12 and 2026-10-14); the old 32×32 hand-drawn art (replaced by generated 256×256 sprites); the old chat's spellings "Healthy Hummy" and "Paper Girl" (the list says Health Hummy and Patty); the old profile README draft on local branch `update-projects` in the `findastra` folder (the Farmer's profile round writes the profile now).

## Task

1. **PC folder rename (needs Astra's yes).** AGENTS.md says the working copies live in `Documents\Astra's PetOS`, but on the PC the folder still had its older name. Per Astra's rule, a folder rename goes through File Master as an **unapproved plan row with the blocker written down**. Proposed row: rename `Documents\Astra's PetOS` to `Documents\Astra's PetOS`. Blockers to check first (`Get-CimInstance Win32_Process`, look for the folder in each command line): any running desktop pet or tray Star started from `astras-pet-os\bin`, `startup-star`, and the shortcut-icon scripts, plus any assistant session whose working folder is inside it. Not done: nothing was renamed.
2. **Role Fairy:** answered (a pet, program Fairy Ring, #83). Still to do for it: `pet.json` with an `audit` block, the `pet-app` topic, the AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md pointers, a README credit line, art, and an INTELLIGENCE-LEVELS.md row. Registering it (moving it from `pipeline` to `pets`) waits for art, and generating art costs money, so that needs Astra.
3. **Nullbot:** answered (dropped). Nothing left to do.
4. **Eleven PC folders have no git repo** (`vrchat-ai-astra`, `mommys`, `rgbee`, `piranesi-house`, `spoonfed-sugarcube`, `fuzzbois`, `image-bridge`, `astras-gif-maker`, `claude-bot`, `discord-damsel`, `findastra.github.io`) and `workflow-whirlpool` has none remote. Per "never leave a program only on the PC", each needs connecting or pushing with Astra's OK; the pet-finder tool's `--local` run lists them.
5. **Local `findastra` folder** is on `update-projects` with one unpushed commit (an old profile draft). Safe to delete once Astra agrees; nothing on GitHub depends on it.
6. **Hide/show button idea list** (kept here so it is not lost): the tray Star already does the tray icon plus gestures. Other ideas from the old chat: a brass key (turn to lock everyone away), the Farmer's hat (tip to send everyone to bed), a moon (bedtime: fall asleep, then fade).

## Done when

Astra has said yes to item 1, merged this branch, and File Master has the rename row (approved or declined), and items 4 and 5 are either connected or consciously left.

## Return

Record the answers and any rename result in the next dated card; set this one to `done`.

## Closed out 2026-10-17 (Astra said yes to all)
- Merged to `main` (main merged into the branch first; two generated-file conflicts and the Platform Platypus move resolved; rebuilt; 89 of 89 tests pass).
- Made `Documents\Astra's PetOS` a junction (shortcut folder) to the folder under its older name, so both names open the same files and nothing moved. The real rename is still the File Master plan row above: blockers are running desktop pets and the tray Star started from the hub's `bin\`, `startup-star`, the folder-icon files in `%LOCALAPPDATA%stras-pet-apps` and any assistant working inside the folder.
- Not done: Role Fairy art and repo files, connecting the folders with no git repo, deleting local branch `update-projects` in `findastra` (that folder has an uncommitted README change from someone else).
