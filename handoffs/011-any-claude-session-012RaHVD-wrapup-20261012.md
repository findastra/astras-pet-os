## What this chat was for
Started 2026-10-09 on `findastra/astras-pet-os`: (1) update the README summary after the
"pets move by kind" commit `ba2259a`; (2) "make sure the version I am running live on my PC is
this one" (Astra chose: merge GitHub's movement-by-kind with the PC's uncommitted roam-free
work, port it to the desktop pets, rebuild and restart); (3) on 2026-10-11, put two
screenshots (her desktop full of pets, and the tray star) near the top of the README.

## What I did
- **PR #1**, branch `claude/readme-cage-movement`, commit `19253e2` (not on `main`): README
  paragraph describing movement by kind in the Cage. **Stale**: the Cage is retired (AGENTS.md);
  close it or rewrite it for the desktop.
- **Branch `claude/movement-by-kind-merge-wip-20261009`, commit `e8759fc`** (not on `main`,
  unfinished, untested, never built): merge of `ba2259a` into a snapshot of Astra's PC working
  copy as of 2026-10-09 00:45 (then `Documents\Projects\findastra-pet-apps`, branch
  `codex/astras-pet-os` at `437bf7e` plus uncommitted roam-free work). Contents:
  `cage_life` renamed `pet_life`; Voicemeeter Bug `kind: "bug"`; movement ported into
  `pets.html` without enclosure modes; movement tests ported into
  `test/pets-controls-test-20261008.mjs`; PET-FILES.md "How pets move" section; a half-done
  `PetLife`/`Mover` port in `scripts/desktop-pets-20261008.cs` that is **not wired** into
  `PetWindow.Step`, `Scatter` or the self-test and has **never been compiled**.
- Nothing was written to Astra's PC. Files were only *read/staged* from
  `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Projects\findastra-pet-apps` (folder access granted 2026-10-09).
  No build, restart or install was done there.
- Screenshots (2026-10-11): **not committed** — Astra said "hold up, we will update later".
- Tests: none run on the WIP branch. `main` was not changed except this card.

## Current state
- `main` has since moved far on (desktop pets in `scripts/desktop-pets-20261011.cs` by Codex,
  tray star, 30+ desktop pets, ASTRAS_PET_OS plan, System Map). The 2026-10-09 PC snapshot and the
  WIP branch predate all of that; use the WIP branch only as reference.
- The live desktop pets (`desktop-pets-20261011.cs`) do **not** read `cage_life`/`pet_life`:
  pets do not move by kind on the desktop. PLAN.md already schedules this for Phase 7
  ("`cage_life` movement rules … move to the desktop host"). Desktop files are Codex's area
  ("Who edits what" in PLAN.md).

## Open decisions waiting on Astra
1. Screenshots at the top of the README: the desktop shot shows BSOD (OpenAI's ChatGPT pet) and
   Claude Bot, and the tray shot shows BSOD. The repo is public and AGENTS.md forbids other
   creators' artwork. Options offered: blur/crop BSOD (recommended), use as-is, or desktop shot
   only. She put this on hold.
2. Whether to still bring movement by kind to the desktop pets now, or leave it for Phase 7.
3. Close PR #1 (stale Cage wording)?

## Next steps, in order
1. Ask Astra decision 3; close PR #1 if yes.
2. When Astra re-sends the screenshots and answers decision 1, add them under the title in
   README.md (images in `art/` or `docs/`, dated filenames), on a branch, with her OK for `main`.
3. If decision 2 is "now": coordinate with Codex (desktop owner), port `pet_life` rules into
   `scripts/desktop-pets-20261011.cs` using `PetLife`/`Mover` on the WIP branch as a starting
   point; keep the 200 ms timer and self-test; build with `build-desktop-pets-20261011.ps1`
   on Astra's PC; run `--self-test`; restart per docs/tray-star-handoff-20261011.md.

## Things this chat relied on (to recreate)
- No scheduled tasks, artifacts, connectors or memory writes were created.
- The Claude desktop app's link to Astra's PC (folder access to
  `Documents\Projects\findastra-pet-apps`) — per session, re-grant if needed.
- GitHub access to `findastra/astras-pet-os` through the session (push to branches).

## Things Astra said here that were not yet in a repo
- 2026-10-09: wanted the PC running "this one" = GitHub's movement by kind **plus** the PC's
  roam-free work (chose "Merge both" over browser-only or replacing the PC copy).
- 2026-10-11: wants her desktop screenshot and the tray screenshot "at the top somewhere" on
  the astras-pet-os page — on hold until she updates them.

## Done when
Decisions 1–3 answered and acted on, and this card set to `status: done`.

## Return
Update this card's `## What I did`, set status, commit.
