# Handoffs

Task cards for whichever assistant picks them up. Format and rules:
[skills/handoff/SKILL.md](../skills/handoff/SKILL.md). Every card has a `## What I did` section
that lists explicitly what was changed, where, and what is not done.

To start: "Take the next open card for <you | any> in findastra/astras-pet-os."

## Card numbers on every branch

A card number is used once, across `main` and every branch. **Before you write a card, take the next free number
below and add its row here in the same commit**, so two chats working at once never pick the same one. Cards written
on a branch keep the number below when they reach `main`. `test/handoff-numbers-test-20261017.mjs` fails when two
cards share a number, or when a card uses a number this table gives to another card.

**Next free number: 031.** Checked on 2026-10-17 across every branch by Claude Opus 5.5 (027 to 029 were taken on branches). When numbers clashed, the
card that reached `main` first kept its number, then the oldest card on a branch.

| No. | Card | Where it is now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 001–012 | The cards in the table above | `main` |
| 013 | `013-goldfish-flash-audit-20261014.md` | Codex branches (PRs #23, #26) |
| 014 | `014-any-rebuild-desktop-for-discord-damsel-20261014.md` | `claude/damsel-starts-presence-20261014` |
| 015 | `015-flash-audit-checkpoint-20261015.md` | Codex branches (PRs #23, #26) |

| 020 | `020-any-chat-sync-and-folder-rename-20261017.md` | `main` |
| 021 | `021-codex-startup-star-api-fairy-bubbles-20261017.md` | `main` (was a second 020) |
| 022 | `022-security-enforcement-and-pet-catalog-20261014.md` | Codex branches (PRs #23, #26), still named `012-…`: rename it to 022 when it is merged |
| 023 | `023-halo-list-vscode-angel-program-20261017.md` | `claude/halo-list-program-20261017`, still named `013-…`: rename it to 023 when it is merged |
| 024 | `024-any-pole-puff-repo-20261012.md` | `claude/pole-puff-draft-20261012` (PR #8; was 010) |
| 025 | `025-any-security-follow-ups-20261017.md` | `main` |
| 026 | `026-any-pictures-astra-takes-20261017.md` | `main` |
| 027 | `027-any-skill-sheet-audit-and-fixes-20261017.md` | `claude/skill-scout-audit-20261017` (PR #50) |
| 028 | `028-any-idle-flash-audit-20261017.md` | `claude/idle-flash-audit-20261017` |
| 029 | `029-codex-hub-folder-back-on-main-20261017.md` | `claude/star-hub-on-main-20261017` |
| 030 | `030-codex-redraw-giraffe-unicorn-group-1-20261017.md` | `claude/pet-art-redesign-20261017` |

Old drafts on dropped branches have no number: `001`–`005` on `pets-roam-life-20261009` (the "claude mini pet"
before it was named Claude Bot, and a new-pet lineup) and `008-farmer-register-new-placeholders.md` on
`claude/card-008-new-placeholders` and `add-backup-beaver-candidate`. If one is ever brought to `main`, it takes the
next free number.
