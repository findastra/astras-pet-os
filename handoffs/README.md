# Handoffs

Task cards for whichever assistant picks them up. Format and rules:
[skills/handoff/SKILL.md](../skills/handoff/SKILL.md). Every card has a `## What I did` section
that lists explicitly what was changed, where, and what is not done.

To start: "Take the next open card for <you | any> in findastra/astras-pet-os."

## Merge order

What Astra merges first, at the top ([skills/merge-order](../skills/merge-order/SKILL.md)). Every chat's title starts
with its number here. Ranked by Claude Opus 5.5 on 2026-10-17; Astra can reorder it.

| # | Pull request | What it is | Chat | Why here |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [astras-pet-os#49](https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-os/pull/49) | "Astra's PetOS" in the hub's names; also fixes the Farmer's desk crash | | #46 (the round fix) merged 2026-10-18, so the round's pushes stay reviewed; it edits the same lines as #46, so it needs a small fix first |
| 2 | [astras-pet-os#52](https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-os/pull/52) | Card 029: the hub folder on Astra's PC is back on `main` | Startup-star version confusion | Small; a card only |
| 3 | [astras-pet-os#53](https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-os/pull/53) | Pet art redesign: group 2 fixes, group 3, A58 | App designs redesign | Art: Astra looks at the pictures |
| 4 | [astras-pet-os#50](https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-os/pull/50) | Card 027: Skill Scout's skill sheet audit; two core contradictions fixed | Skill Scout audit | Changes core rules: read with care |
| 5 | [astras-pet-os#51](https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-os/pull/51) | Idle Flash Audit round cards (iPad), A57 | Idle Flash Audit | Audit records |
| 6 | [astras-pet-os#23](https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-os/pull/23) | Codex: README auditor, plus PR #26 (The Threshold, Liminal Doors, and the security model that replaces the rings and the Known gaps table) | Codex | Needs Astra's decision on the security model; large |
| 7 | [astras-pet-os#36](https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-os/pull/36) | Fuzzbois is now Fuzzboi Factory | | Feature |
| 8 | [astras-pet-os#22](https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-os/pull/22) | Codex: keep reviewed profile READMEs during daily rounds | Codex | Feature |
| 9 | [astras-pet-os#8](https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-os/pull/8) | Pole Puff draft pet app (its card becomes 024) | | Feature, oldest |
| 10 | #1, #3, #4, #5, #7 | Cage-era pull requests from 2026-10-09 and 2026-10-10 | | Close? The Cage is retired; most are superseded |

Chats waiting on Astra with no pull request: **Astra's PetOS System Map** (pick access-rule option A, B or C; A recommended)
and **Idle Flash Audit** (whether to set up Kimi as a checker). Re-ranked 2026-10-18 by Claude Opus 5.5. #46, #47 and ghost-protocol#3 left the list when they merged (2026-10-18).

## Card numbers on every branch

A card number is used once, across `main` and every branch. **Before you write a card, take the next free number
below and add its row here in the same commit**, so two chats working at once never pick the same one. Cards written
on a branch keep the number below when they reach `main`. `test/handoff-numbers-test-20261017.mjs` fails when two
cards share a number, or when a card uses a number this table gives to another card.

**Next free number: 027.** Checked on 2026-10-17 across every branch by Claude Opus 5.5. When numbers clashed, the
card that reached `main` first kept its number, then the oldest card on a branch.

| No. | Card | Where it is now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 001–012 | The cards in the table above | `main` |
| 013 | `013-goldfish-flash-audit-20261014.md` | Codex branches (PRs #23, #26) |
| 014 | `014-any-rebuild-desktop-for-discord-damsel-20261014.md` | `claude/damsel-starts-presence-20261014` |
| 015 | `015-flash-audit-checkpoint-20261015.md` | Codex branches (PRs #23, #26) |
| 016 | `016-world-caretakers-and-l3-activity-20261016.md` | `codex/world-caretakers-20261016` (PR #26) |
| 017 | `017-any-api-fairy-desktop-verify-20261017.md` | `main` |
| 018 | `018-any-curious-faces-and-hummy-beak-20261017.md` | `claude/chat-reconcile-20261017` (PR #37) |
| 019 | `019-any-portfolio-puffer-and-the-portfolio-20261017.md` | `claude/chat-reconcile-20261017` (PR #37) |
| 020 | `020-any-chat-sync-and-folder-rename-20261017.md` | `main` |
| 021 | `021-codex-startup-star-api-fairy-bubbles-20261017.md` | `main` (was a second 020) |
| 022 | `022-security-enforcement-and-pet-catalog-20261014.md` | Codex branches (PRs #23, #26), still named `012-…`: rename it to 022 when it is merged |
| 023 | `023-halo-list-vscode-angel-program-20261017.md` | `claude/halo-list-program-20261017`, still named `013-…`: rename it to 023 when it is merged |
| 024 | `024-any-pole-puff-repo-20261012.md` | `claude/pole-puff-draft-20261012` (PR #8; was 010) |
| 025 | `025-any-security-follow-ups-20261017.md` | `main` |
| 026 | `026-any-pictures-astra-takes-20261017.md` | `main` |

Old drafts on dropped branches have no number: `001`–`005` on `pets-roam-life-20261009` (the "claude mini pet"
before it was named Claude Bot, and a new-pet lineup) and `008-farmer-register-new-placeholders.md` on
`claude/card-008-new-placeholders` and `add-backup-beaver-candidate`. If one is ever brought to `main`, it takes the
next free number.
