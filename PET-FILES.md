# Pet files: the rules for every pet app

*Part of the Cage ([README](README.md)). The GitHub Goldfish checks these rules across the whole account.*

**Every pet program is built to [PET-PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK.md](PET-PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK.md)** (Astra, 2026-10-13): tool boxes with
versioned labels, ON/OFF and sick on every tool, the notes tool and backlog, the chat bot, links by kind, the status line,
its System Map node, and data that survives updates. Names and versions follow its section 2.

Every pet app is its own repo under `findastra`, named in lowercase words joined by hyphens. Every pet repo has:

| File or setting | Rule |
|---|---|
| **`pet.json`** | See below. Includes an `audit` block. |
| **GitHub topic** | `pet-app`. Added in the repo's About box (the gear). The Cage finds pets by this topic. |
| **`README.md`** | Title is the repo name in Title Case. The first lines include `*A pet app by Astra.*`. Has a "how to run it" section and a "limits" section that says plainly what is not done. |
| **`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`** | Rules so any assistant can pick the repo up. |
| **A pet** | Drawn in the shared style (below). What every part of a pet app is called: [PET-WORDS.md](PET-WORDS.md). |
| **Model and version** | The assistant that built or changed it is recorded (e.g. `Claude Sonnet 5.5 (claude-sonnet-5-5), 2026-10-07`). |
| **A `LICENSE`** | House default: MIT, "Copyright (c) <year> findastra". |

Public credit is always **Astra**. No keys, `.env` files or personal data in a repo, and no work information. Health and finance pets keep their data on the user's PC.

## pet.json

```json
{
  "pet": "GitHub Goldfish",
  "kind": "pet-app",
  "owner": "Astra",
  "sprite": "sprite.json",
  "job": "One sentence on what it does.",
  "runs_on": "Where it runs.",
  "entry": "index.html",
  "status": "hatching",
  "cage": { "topic": "pet-app", "home": "README.md" },
  "built_with": "Claude Sonnet 5.5 (claude-sonnet-5-5), 2026-10-07",
  "audit": { "cadence": "weekly", "subject": "the findastra GitHub account", "needs": "a GitHub token that can read the private repos" }
}
```

`status` is **hatching** (idea or first draft), **growing** (works, rough edges) or **grown** (finished and maintained). `sprite` and `entry` must be real files in the repo.

## The pet's art

**Chip is an owner-requested exception:** its original Data Dealer `drawPet` pixels are rendered
by `scripts/chip-original-20261008.mjs` at integer scale inside the original yellow pocket shell.
The registry's `art_source` selects this native renderer; image generation skips it. Its exact
LCD palette, geometry and original expression shapes are preserved. The Cage's nine moods use
the original expression and bob/blink states plus the shared mood stickers.

Pets are **generated** pixel art, not hand-coded any more. One image per pet holds the same
character nine times in a 3×3 grid; a script slices it into the nine moods. The character stays
identical across its moods because it was drawn in a single generation — nine separate
generations give nine slightly different creatures, which is why it is done this way.

- **256 by 256 pixels** for finished transparent mood frames. Mommy's Mommies are two characters
  who are never drawn apart, so they share one square sprite.
- A solid **black outline one pixel thick** around the whole silhouette.
- **Neon, deliberately unnatural colours, and no two pets share a palette.** At sprite size the
  palette tells them apart faster than the silhouette does.
- Dot eyes with a single white highlight, small pink blush cheeks.
- The generator is told **never** to draw the mood symbols. See "One set of mood stickers" below.

### Making or redoing a pet's art

1. Add or edit the pet's line in [`scripts/generate-pets.mjs`](scripts/generate-pets.mjs):
   what the creature is, and its neon colours. The shared `STYLE` string holds everything the
   pets have in common; never fork it per pet.
2. `node scripts/generate-pets.mjs <id>` generates the sheet and converts it. Sheets already on
   disk are skipped, so re-running is cheap and safe; `--force` redoes one.
3. `npm run build` converts the sheets and draws `art/roster.png`. **Look at it** before
   calling anything done.

Each pet costs one image from the image bridge, billed to Astra's OpenAI account, so do not
regenerate the whole set to change one pet.

**Never plainly regenerate a pet whose art Astra has approved.** One generation produces all
nine moods together, so there is no way to redo a single frame: the whole character is re-rolled
and the body comes back different. It has already happened once — asking for spectacles returned
a visibly slimmer penguin. Use `--match` instead:

```
node scripts/generate-pets.mjs <id> --match
```

That keeps a copy of the pet's first approved sheet in `art/sheets/.approved/` and feeds it back
as the reference image, so the model redraws the expressions around the body that exists. Small
additions like glasses should not be generated at all; draw them in
[`scripts/accessories.mjs`](scripts/accessories.mjs), which cannot disturb the body.

A pet can be generated **from another pet's sheet** by giving it `ref`, so the two share a
character design: Astra is one of the Mommy's dancers in a different colourway, generated from
their sheet. The runner always generates a referenced pet first.

### One set of mood stickers

`?`, `!`, `Z`, the tear, the sweat drop and the bandage are **composited from the shared
sticker set** in [`scripts/art-kit.mjs`](scripts/art-kit.mjs), never drawn by the generator.
They are pixel-identical on every pet, so the mood can be read at a glance without learning
each character. A generated sheet that contains a drawn symbol is wrong and should be redone.

### The old hand-drawn system

[`scripts/pets-art.mjs`](scripts/pets-art.mjs) drew the first 32×32 pets by hand with a small
pixel toolkit. It is kept for the drawing primitives and the sticker set that
`art-kit.mjs` exports, and as the record of the original style:

- 32 by 32, one soft coloured outline, a light edge top-left and a shadow bottom-right,
  dot eyes with a highlight, pink cheeks, symmetric about the centre.
- **Nine moods**, all drawn: `idle`, `blink`, `happy`, `curious`, `worried`, `sad`, `sick`, `alarmed`, `sleep`. Each has a clear change: `sad` adds a tear, `sick` tints green and adds a plaster, `worried` adds a sweat drop, `alarmed` adds a "!", `sleep` adds "z".
- Pets **bounce around the screen**: a small hop as they move, a squash when they hit a wall, a blink every few seconds.

### What each mood means

Every pet uses the same nine meanings, so Astra can read any pet's face without learning it twice. A pet must be able to reach all nine; a mood that is drawn but never shown is a bug.

| Mood | The pet is saying |
|---|---|
| `sleep` | I have not run yet, or I have no data. |
| `idle` | I am resting. Nothing to report. |
| `blink` | (idle only, every few seconds) |
| `curious` | I am working on it. |
| `happy` | I finished and found nothing wrong. |
| `worried` | I finished and found problems. |
| `alarmed` | I finished and found a lot of problems. |
| `sick` | **I am stuck and I need you.** |
| `sad` | I could not finish, and that is my fault. |

`sick` is the only mood that asks Astra for something. Use it whenever the pet cannot go on without her: a site needs her to sign in, a token or key is missing or expired, a permission was refused, a file or folder it was pointed at is not there, an app it manages is not installed. It is **not** for problems the pet found in its subject matter (that is `worried` / `alarmed`) and **not** for the pet's own crash (that is `sad`). When a pet goes `sick` it must say in words what it needs and how to give it.
- Current frame paths are recorded in `art/frames/index.json`. Consumers use that index so they support both existing mood filenames and dated filenames. A pet repo can copy its own frames.

## How pets move in the Cage

Every pet's `kind` in `pets.json` picks a row in `cage_life.kinds`, and `cage.html` reads the
rules from there. Nothing about movement is hard-coded per pet.

| Rule | What it does now |
|---|---|
| `zone: "sky"` | Birds, ghosts, the fairy, the sprite (Astra Wisp) and the angel stay in the top third. |
| `zone: "swim"` | The fish stays at mid height. |
| `zone: "ground"` | Everyone else walks the floor. `hops: true` (humans) bounces as they walk. |
| `climbs: true` | The cat runs up a side wall, hangs, and leaps back off. It always climbs when chased. |
| `flock: true` | Birds fly a loose V behind the first bird in the roster. |
| `friends` | API Fairy, Unity Unicorn and Astra Wisp hang out; so do Paper Girl, File Master and Chip. |
| `tag` | Drum Dog and Python Panther chase each other, taking turns being "it". |
| `chases` | Birds chase bugs and the fish; the fish chases bugs. The chased one runs away. |

Names in `friends`, `tag` and `chases` can be an art id or a kind. A new bug only needs
`"kind": "bug"` to be chased by the birds and the fish. A kind that is not listed simply wanders.
Play never changes a pet's mood: moods report the app's state (below), not the game.

## Adding a pet to the Cage

Saving goes upward: the pet's repo first, then the Farmer, then everything generated ([RELATIONS.md](RELATIONS.md) has the picture).

1. **In the new pet's repo:** `pet.json` (with an `audit` block, below), the `pet-app` topic, README, AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md. AGENTS.md links this repo (`findastra/astras-pet-os`) and says changes are submitted to the Farmer.
2. **The Farmer's daily round finds it** and adds it to `pipeline` in pets.json, so the Cage, the Farmer's desk and Astra's profile know about it the next morning. To do it straight away, add the `pipeline` entry yourself and leave a card `NNN-farmer-register-<repo>.md`.
3. **Registering it** (moving it from `pipeline` to `pets`) needs its art. Add its prompt to `PETS` in `scripts/generate-pets.mjs`, then ask Astra first: generating costs money. With `asset_date: "20261009"`, its sheet is `art/sheets/<art>-20261009.png` and its frames are `art/frames/<art>/idle-20261009.png`, etc. The entry needs `repo`, `pet`, `role: "pet"`, `kind` (how it moves), `status`, `job`, `art`, `published`, `added` and `audit`.
4. `npm run build`, `npm run check`, `npm test`.
5. The GitHub Goldfish's weekly audit checks the files and the registry from then on.

## Rounds, self-audits and submissions

Every pet checks itself on a schedule and reports in the same nine moods, so Astra can read any pet's face the same way. The Friendly Farmer runs it all from one place: `scripts/farmer-rounds-20261009.mjs`, every morning, from `.github/workflows/farmer-daily-rounds.yml`.

**The daily round:**

1. Finds pet repos on GitHub the Cage does not know (a `pet.json` or the `pet-app` topic) and adds them to `pipeline`.
2. Takes each pet's **submission** (below).
3. Runs the **self-audits** that are due. Each pet runs on its `audit.cadence`: `weekly` pets on their own day of the week (spread across the week, listed in [MOOD-KEY.md](MOOD-KEY.md)); the Farmer every day.
4. Writes `status/pets-status.json`: each pet's mood, a one-line bubble, and what it needs from Astra. The Cage page rests each pet in that mood and shows the bubble when clicked; the Farmer's desk lists everyone who **Needs you**.
5. Rebuilds, runs `npm test`, and opens a **pull request** as the Friendly Farmer, from the branch `farmer/rounds-YYYYMMDD`. It never pushes to `main`: Astra reads the changes and merges them (known gap 11, closed 2026-10-17). A newer round's pull request replaces an older one that is still open.

**What a self-audit checks:** the pet files above (pet.json, README credit line, "how to run it" and "Limits", AGENTS.md pointing at the Cage, CLAUDE.md, LICENSE and the `pet-app` topic for public repos), plus anything only Astra can answer.

**How the mood is chosen, the same way for every pet:**

| Mood | When | Bubble |
|---|---|---|
| `sleep` | Not checked yet, or the Farmer cannot see the repo | Not checked yet. |
| `curious` | Being checked right now | |
| `happy` | Checked today, nothing to fix | All good. |
| `idle` | Clean, last checked more than a day ago | |
| `worried` | 1 to 5 things to fix | `3 to fix: my README needs "Limits", …` |
| `alarmed` | More than 5, or a broken pet.json | same |
| `sick` | **Only Astra can unblock it:** its job is still a placeholder, or one of its cards says `waiting on Astra: …` or is `for: astra` | `Need: the brand and model of each light` |
| `sad` | The check itself failed | |

So to ask Astra for something, a pet leaves a card with `status: open (waiting on Astra: <what you need>)`. The words after the colon become its bubble.

**What each mood means for each pet** comes from `mood_key` in pets.json, filled in with the pet's `audit.subject` (what it checks) and `audit.needs` (what it asks for when sick). The full key is in [MOOD-KEY.md](MOOD-KEY.md) and on the Farmer's desk.

### The audit block

In pets.json, and copied into the pet's own pet.json:

```json
"audit": { "cadence": "weekly", "subject": "your RGB lights and scenes", "needs": "the brand and model of each light" }
```

`cadence` is `daily`, `weekly` or `monthly`.

### Submitting a change to the Farmer

A pet owns its own job, status, bubble lines, mood lines and audit. When it changes any of them, it **submits** the change in its own pet.json, with the date. Its **name** is not submitted this way: names live only in `pet-programs.json` (AGENTS.md, "One list of names"), so a `pet` in `cage.submit` becomes a note for Astra in the round's pull request, never a change:

```json
"cage": {
  "topic": "pet-app",
  "home": "README.md",
  "submit": {
    "date": "2026-10-10",
    "job": "One sentence on what it does now.",
    "status": "growing",
    "says": ["bzz", "all lights on the same page"],
    "moods": { "happy": "Every light took the scene." },
    "audit": { "cadence": "weekly", "needs": "the brand and model of each light" }
  }
}
```

Include only what changed. The next daily round takes it (once per date) and updates pets.json in its pull request; once Astra merges it, the Cage, the desk, MOOD-KEY.md and the profile follow. Art, `kind`, friends and relations belong to the Farmer: ask for those with a card in this repo's `handoffs/`, because new art costs money and needs Astra's OK.

A pet that changes its job in pet.json **without** submitting gets a note in its self-audit, so the two never drift apart unnoticed.

### Who tells whom

`relations` in pets.json lists which pet passes what to which: registry, status, findings, cards, key notes, ideas, what shipped, live cues, art. [RELATIONS.md](RELATIONS.md) draws it. Links whose other end is not a pet with a repo (AI models, the Farm, the Kennel, programs, seeds, roadmap pets) go in [system-map.json](system-map.json); the [System Map](system-map-20261012.html) draws both in 3D. Health Hummy, Finance Finch and Meme Fiend are private: their data never leaves the PC and no other pet reads from them.
