# Mood key

*What each mood means, for every pet. Generated from `mood_key` and each pet's `audit` in [pets.json](pets.json) by `npm run build`. The Farmer's desk shows the same key with each pet's current mood and bubble.*

Every pet uses the same meanings, so a face reads the same everywhere. `{subject}` is what the pet checks; `{needs}` is what it asks Astra for when it is sick.

| Mood | Means |
|---|---|
| `sleep` | I haven't checked {subject} yet. |
| `idle` | {Subject} was fine at my last check. |
| `blink` | Just blinking. |
| `curious` | Checking {subject} now. |
| `happy` | Checked {subject}: nothing wrong. |
| `worried` | Found a few problems in {subject}. |
| `alarmed` | Found a lot of problems in {subject}. |
| `sick` | I need you: {needs}. |
| `sad` | I couldn't finish checking {subject}. My fault; I'll try again. |

## Each pet

A pet changes its own lines by submitting `moods` (and `audit`) in `cage.submit` in its pet.json. See [PET-FILES.md](PET-FILES.md).
