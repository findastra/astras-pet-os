# Naming audit (Flash Audit A06 + A07), 2026-10-16

*The naming part of the [Flash Audit](https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-os/blob/codex/world-caretakers-20261016/docs/flash-audit-20261014.md): A06 (pet name) and A07 (program name). Run for Astra by Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`), 2026-10-16. Owner: GitHub Goldfish (GitHub Aquarium). Recorded on The Farm.*

## Where I looked

| Source | What | Covered |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub | All 93 repos under `findastra`, the `pet.json` in each, and every branch of `astras-pet-os` (41 branches) | ✅ |
| `pet-programs.json` and `pets.json` | `main` and the Codex branches (`world-caretakers`, `yellow-phone`, `findastra-readme-auditor`, `identity-bound-access`) | ✅ |
| Saved AI conversations on Astra's PC | 65 conversations in `Documents\Chats` (Chat Rat's archive): Codex (GPT-5.6, GPT-6, GPT-6.1) and Claude Code (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku), 2026-08-31 to 2026-10-16 17:10, plus `conversation-discord-presence-20261014.txt`. I read every message Astra wrote about pets and every answer she gave to a naming question | ✅ |
| Pet folders on the PC | `Documents\Astra's PetOS` (41 folders), `Documents\ChatGPT`, `Documents\Codex` | ✅ |
| **Not covered** | ChatGPT phone and web chats (Intel Owl came from one), claude.ai chats, and Codex sessions after Chat Rat's last save (17:10 on 2026-10-16). Chat Rat cannot save these yet, and access to `.codex` was not granted | ⚠️ Not verified |

## Total

**82 numbered pets**, plus **3 pets with no number yet**: **85 in all**.

| | Count |
|---|---|
| Numbered pets (`pet-programs.json`, #1 to #82) | 82: 19 registered, 17 pipeline, 15 seed, 31 roadmap |
| Have their own repo on GitHub | 80 (#81 Intel Owl and #82 Door Dormouse have none) |
| Pet program (home) decided | **41** |
| Pet program not decided yet | **41** (next: **#39 Procreate Panda**; #31–#33 had no preference in round 19) |
| Pet name not decided | 1 (#77, `pet-program-77-icon-77`) |
| Not numbered yet | 3: **Workflow Whale** (Workflow Whirlpool, only on the PC), **Index Mole** (named by Astra on 2026-10-12, never recorded), **Role Fairy** (pet #13 on the 2026-10-07 roster, now only a Discord repo) |

## Exceptions (Flash Audit format: only Missing, Incorrect and Not verified)

| Check | Pet | Status | Finding | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A07 | 19 pets (#2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 42, 82) | **Fixed** | Astra named these on 2026-10-15 and 2026-10-16 in Codex. The names were only on unmerged Codex branches, so `main`, the profile and the System Map still said `pet-program-#` | Brought over to `main` in this change |
| A07 | #9 Finance Finch | Pass, but worth knowing | She picked *The Counting House*, then changed it to **Nest Egg** ("no wait i wanyed nest egg") | Nest Egg kept |
| A06 | #77 | Missing | `pet-program-77-icon-77` is a placeholder. Codex suggested **Vet Vole**, with the program **The Triage Desk** | Astra picks |
| A06/A07 | #37 Dubstep Gunsmith | **Fixed** | A home sits in the pet slot. On 2026-10-12 Astra said "the Dubstep Gunsmith **Guy** (icon) represents the Dubstep Gunsmith (program)". On 2026-10-14 she asked for "Dubstep Gunsmith Shop, or something more clever" | Astra: Dubstep Gunsmith represents the **Dubstep Armory** (2026-10-16) |
| A06 | #11 Patty, #17 Gone Ghost | Incorrect | The pet's own `pet.json` still says Paper Girl and Ghost Protocol (the 2026-10-12 renames) | Each pet's chat updates its repo |
| A07 | 25 repos | Missing | The pet's own `pet.json` has no `program`. #12 and #42 still say `pet-program-#`. Codex's `yellow-phone` branches may fix some of them; they are not merged | Next Flash Audit round on each repo |
| A06 | #35 Chat Rat | Missing | Not in the `pets.json` registry. Registering a pet moves it through the gate | Astra decides |
| A06 | Workflow Whale | Missing | `workflow-whirlpool` is only on the PC: no repo and no number | Push with Astra's OK, then give it #83 |
| A06 | Index Mole | Missing | Astra described it on 2026-10-12 ("Rift Rabbit … calling the Index Mole to investigate … Wi-Fi congestion"). It never reached a list | Astra: seed or tool? |
| A06 | Role Fairy | Not verified | On the 2026-10-07 roster as pet #13 (`role-fairy`, growing). It later dropped out, and the repo has no `pet.json` | Astra: pet, or Discord bot only? |
| A06 | Intel Owl #81 | Not verified | Comes from a ChatGPT phone chat I can't see ("replaces Scout Fox / Intel Ibis") | Fine as a seed; the source chat is not archived |

## Why things keep getting missed

There isn't one missing step. There are four gaps, and every one comes down to decisions being made in chats that don't write them to The Farm:

1. **Decisions stay on branches.** Astra named 19 homes on 2026-10-15/16, but Codex saved them on review branches (`codex/world-caretakers-20261016` and three others). Those branches also hold 100+ other files, so nobody merged them, and the names never reached `main`. The Flash Audit sheet and cards 013 and 015 are stuck the same way.
2. **Chats are not an inbox.** A pet named in a conversation (Index Mole, Role Fairy, the phone pets) only exists if that chat writes it down. Chat Rat saves the conversations, but nothing reads them.
3. **There are several lists.** `pets.json`, its `seeds`, `pet-programs.json`, `INTELLIGENCE-LEVELS.md`, `docs/naming-20261013.md`, each repo's `pet.json` and local `*-candidate-*.json` files all hold names. Each assistant updates the one it knows about.
4. **Rounds stop when the chat stops.** The naming round stopped at 17 of 68 when the conversation turned to tools. Nothing recorded where it stopped.

**The fix (intake step):** every chat that names, renames or creates a pet writes one line to `pet-programs.json`, and **only** that file, in its own tiny commit merged that day. Everything else is built from it. Then the Friendly Farmer's daily round runs pet-finder over GitHub and the Chat Rat archive, and lists any name that isn't recorded.

## Done in this change

- `pet-programs.json`:
  - The 19 home names from Codex's branch.
  - #81 Intel Owl (seed) and #82 Door Dormouse / The Threshold (seed).
  - Nessi's Ocean's descriptor.
  - Newer `idea` suggestions.
- `pets.json` seeds: Intel Owl and Door Dormouse added; Piranesi Nessi's program set to Nessi's Ocean.
- This record.

Nothing on Astra's PC was changed. No repo was created or renamed.
