**Fix PR waiting for you:** [mail-snail#2](https://github.com/findastra/mail-snail/pull/2)

### Exceptions

1. **A16 pet.json** — Missing. Metadata: framework declaration  
   *Next:* Framework metadata comes with the shared page framework (Codex's branch); not added by hand tonight.
2. **A16 pet.json** — Incorrect. pet.json job differs from the registry. pet.json: "Planned: looks through Astra's mail for bills she has not paid yet and tells Finance Finch. Bill details stay on her PC; it connects to no m"  
   *Next:* The pet submitted a different job to the Farmer: see Decisions.
3. **A17 Git branches** — Incorrect. 2 branch(es) with work not on main and no open pull request: codex/l3-activity-20261016 (+2), codex/yellow-phone-20261015 (+1).

### Fixed tonight (in the fix PR, waiting for your merge)

- **A57 Current names only** — Retired names (the old hub names, findastra-pet-apps, Documents\Projects) in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `desktop-pet-20261011.json`, `pet.json`.
- **A16 pet.json** — pet.json has no audit block (the registry has one).
- **A31 Links** — 2 links point at the old hub name or a missing file: <https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-os>, <https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-os/blob/main/handoffs/008-farmer-register-new-placeholders.md>.

<details><summary>What the fix PR changes, exactly</summary>

- Retired names: 10 replacement(s) in AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, desktop-pet-20261011.json, pet.json (old hub names / findastra-pet-apps -> astras-pet-os and Astra's PetOS, Documents\Projects -> Documents\Astra's PetOS). History lines kept as written.
- Not changed: pet.json job differs from the registry, and the pet submitted a job to the Farmer on 2026-10-12. That submission needs the Farmer and Astra.
- pet.json: audit block copied from the registry.
- README: the stale "Not in the Cage yet ... card 008" line now says it is a pipeline pet in pets.json (card 008 is an old dropped draft).
- 2026-10-18 refresh: Brought up to date with main (3 new commit(s) there); main's version was kept where both changed a line, and desktop-pet-20261011.json stays deleted as main deleted it. Retired names again after the merge: 2 in AGENTS.md, README.md. Not changed: the pet submitted its own job on 2026-10-12; that waits on the Farmer and Astra. pet.json: audit block from the registry. README: the stale card 008 line now says it is a pipeline pet. Credit line is now "An Intelligent App, or Pet, by Astra." (card 033): 2 change(s) in AGENTS.md, README.md. Art prompts and provenance notes keep their wording.

### Decisions

1. **Job:** Mail Snail submitted its own job to the Farmer (2026-10-12), and the registry says something else. Which one is right?
  - Pet's own: "Planned: looks through Astra's mail for bills she has not paid yet and tells Finance Finch. Bill details stay on her PC; it connects to no mail account yet."
  - Registry: "Organizes your mail: sorts it, cleans it up and deletes what you no longer need, always with your OK first. Connects to no mail account yet."
2. **Branches with work not on main** and no pull request: [`codex/l3-activity-20261016`](https://github.com/findastra/mail-snail/compare/main...codex%2Fl3-activity-20261016) (+2), [`codex/yellow-phone-20261015`](https://github.com/findastra/mail-snail/compare/main...codex%2Fyellow-phone-20261015) (+1). Open a PR, merge, or leave?
3. **Merge the fix PR** [mail-snail#2](https://github.com/findastra/mail-snail/pull/2)? It only holds fixes that need no decision (listed above).

**Tools:** none declared in pet.json yet (A18).  
**Tutorial tools:** Play with, Care for — Not verified overnight.
