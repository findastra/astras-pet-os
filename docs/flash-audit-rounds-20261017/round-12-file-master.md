**Fix PR waiting for you:** [file-master#5](https://github.com/findastra/file-master/pull/5)

### Exceptions

1. **A54 Third-party programs** — Missing. INTELLIGENCE-LEVELS lists programs made by others (Everything, SpaceSniffer) but the page has no Third Party Programs row.  
   *Next:* The Intelligence Levels table lists programs made by others that the page does not show (or the other way round): match them.
2. **A57 Current names only** — Incorrect. Retired names (Astra's Pet Apps, astras-pet-apps, findastra-pet-apps, Documents\Projects) in `agent/file-master.md`, `file-master-20261008.html`.  
   *Next:* Inside code (a storage key or a name the code looks for), so it was left alone tonight.
3. **A17 Git branches** — Incorrect. 2 branch(es) with work not on main and no open pull request: codex/l3-activity-20261016 (+2), codex/yellow-phone-20261015 (+1).  
   *Next:* See Decisions: open a pull request, merge, or leave each branch.
4. **A55 Pictures** — Missing. README shows 1 picture(s).  
   *Next:* Needs real pictures of the program working (you take some: card 026).
5. **A18 Tool list** — Not verified. Declared tool inventory exists; compare each declaration with real behavior.  
   *Next:* No tool list yet. It comes with the shared page framework.
6. **A52 L3 activity bubble** — On a branch. Required shared L3 activity bubble/config/script/style not found in the inspected entry source.  
   *Next:* It is built on unmerged branch `codex/l3-activity-20261016` ([compare](https://github.com/findastra/file-master/compare/main...codex/l3-activity-20261016)): merging that branch passes this.
7. **A44 Yellow phone** — On a branch. Shared phone baseline not found.  
   *Next:* It is built on unmerged branch `codex/l3-activity-20261016` ([compare](https://github.com/findastra/file-master/compare/main...codex/l3-activity-20261016)): merging that branch passes this.
8. **A45 Paper and zoom** — On a branch. Shared stationery source not found.  
   *Next:* It is built on unmerged branch `codex/l3-activity-20261016` ([compare](https://github.com/findastra/file-master/compare/main...codex/l3-activity-20261016)): merging that branch passes this.
9. **A41 Clicker Training** — On a branch. No Clicker Training section found in the inspected entry source.  
   *Next:* It is built on unmerged branch `codex/l3-activity-20261016` ([compare](https://github.com/findastra/file-master/compare/main...codex/l3-activity-20261016)): merging that branch passes this.

### Fixed tonight (in the fix PR, waiting for your merge)

- **A15 README and credit** — README has no Limits section.
- **A57 Current names only** — Retired names (Astra's Pet Apps, astras-pet-apps, findastra-pet-apps, Documents\Projects) in `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `desktop-pet-20261011.json`.
- **A16 pet.json** — Metadata: audit cadence pet.json has no audit block (the registry has one).
- **A16 pet.json** — pet.json job differs from the registry. pet.json: "Keeps a Windows PC organized: read-only audits and approval-based cleanup plans with undo. Never deletes."

<details><summary>What the fix PR changes, exactly</summary>

- Retired names: 13 replacement(s) in AGENTS.md, README.md, agent/file-master.md, desktop-pet-20261011.json, file-master-20261008.html (astras-pet-apps / findastra-pet-apps -> astras-pet-os, Astra's Pet Apps -> Astra's PetOS, Documents\Projects -> Documents\Astra's PetOS). History lines kept as written.
- pet.json: job now matches the registry; audit block copied from the registry.
- README: added a Limits section from INTELLIGENCE-LEVELS.md.
- 2026-10-18 refresh: Brought up to date with main (3 new commit(s) there); main's version was kept where both changed a line, and desktop-pet-20261011.json stays deleted as main deleted it. Retired names again after the merge: 3 in AGENTS.md, file-master-20261008.html. README: Limits section from INTELLIGENCE-LEVELS.md. Credit line is now "An Intelligent App, or Pet, by Astra." (card 033): 1 change(s) in README.md. Art prompts and provenance notes keep their wording.
- 2026-10-18: pet.json now use the program name "File Kingdom" from pet-programs.json; the "Name not assigned yet" line is gone (the repo keeps its name).

### Decisions

1. **Branches with work not on main** and no pull request: [`codex/l3-activity-20261016`](https://github.com/findastra/file-master/compare/main...codex%2Fl3-activity-20261016) (+2), [`codex/yellow-phone-20261015`](https://github.com/findastra/file-master/compare/main...codex%2Fyellow-phone-20261015) (+1). Open a PR, merge, or leave?
2. **Merge the fix PR** [file-master#5](https://github.com/findastra/file-master/pull/5)? It only holds fixes that need no decision (listed above).

**Tools:** none declared in pet.json yet (A18).  
**Tutorial tools:** Play with, Care for — Not verified overnight.
