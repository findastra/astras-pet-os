**Fix PR waiting for you:** [role-fairy#1](https://github.com/findastra/role-fairy/pull/1)

### Exceptions

1. **A01 Icon** — Missing. No icon in astras-pet-os art/icons.  
   *Next:* Needs pet art. Generating art costs money, so it waits for your OK.
2. **A15 README and credit** — Incorrect. README title "Mommy’s Role Fairy" is neither the repo name in Title Case ("Role Fairy") nor the pet name.  
   *Next:* The title is a naming choice, so it was left alone. Rename the heading?
3. **A16 pet.json** — Missing. Metadata: sprite target, framework declaration  
   *Next:* Framework metadata comes with the shared page framework (Codex's branch); not added by hand tonight.
4. **A55 Pictures** — Missing. README shows 0 picture(s).  
   *Next:* Needs real pictures of the program working (you take some: card 026).

   *Next:* No tool list yet. It comes with the shared page framework.

### Fixed tonight (in the fix PR, waiting for your merge)

- **A09 Program page** — pet.json declares no entry (the program page).
- **A14 Required files** — Required files: pet.json, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, LICENSE
- **A15 README and credit** — README lacks the credit line "*An Intelligent App, or Pet, by Astra.*". No model, version and date recorded.
- **A16 pet.json** — pet.json is not a JSON object.

<details><summary>What the fix PR changes, exactly</summary>

- Added pet.json from its registry entry (job, status and audit as the registry has them; no sprite yet, its art waits on Astra).
- Added CLAUDE.md (pointer to AGENTS.md and the hub rules).
- Added AGENTS.md (house rules pointer).
- Added LICENSE (MIT, the house default for public pet repos).
- README: added the credit line "*An Intelligent App, or Pet, by Astra.*".
- 2026-10-18 refresh: Brought up to date with main (1 new commit(s) there); where both changed a line, main's version was kept and the fixes below were applied again on top. Credit line is now "An Intelligent App, or Pet, by Astra." (card 033): 2 change(s) in AGENTS.md, README.md. Art prompts and provenance notes keep their wording.

### Decisions

1. **Role Fairy needs art** before the Farmer can register it (card 020). Generating art costs money: OK to generate?
2. **Merge the fix PR** [role-fairy#1](https://github.com/findastra/role-fairy/pull/1)? It only holds fixes that need no decision (listed above).

**Tools:** none declared in pet.json yet (A18).  
**Tutorial tools:** Play with, Care for — Not verified overnight.
