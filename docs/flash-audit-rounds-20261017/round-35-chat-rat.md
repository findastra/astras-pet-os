### Fixed tonight (in the fix PR, waiting for your merge)

- **A15 README and credit** — README has no Limits section.
- **A57 Current names only** — Retired names (the old hub names, findastra-pet-apps, Documents\Projects) in `AGENTS.md`, `desktop-pet-20261011.json`, `pet.json`, `sprite-20261009.json`.
- **A31 Links** — Link to the hub under its old repo name: repo renamed to astras-pet-os.

<details><summary>What the fix PR changes, exactly</summary>

- Retired names: 6 replacement(s) in AGENTS.md, desktop-pet-20261011.json, pet.json, sprite-20261009.json (old hub names / findastra-pet-apps -> astras-pet-os and Astra's PetOS, Documents\Projects -> Documents\Astra's PetOS). History lines kept as written.
- README: added a Limits section from INTELLIGENCE-LEVELS.md.
- 2026-10-18 refresh: Brought up to date with main (7 new commit(s) there); main's version was kept where both changed a line, and desktop-pet-20261011.json stays deleted as main deleted it. Retired names again after the merge: 1 in AGENTS.md. README: Limits section from INTELLIGENCE-LEVELS.md. Credit line is now "An Intelligent App, or Pet, by Astra." (card 033): 1 change(s) in README.md. Art prompts and provenance notes keep their wording.
