### Fixed tonight (in the fix PR, waiting for your merge)

- **A57 Current names only** — Retired names (the old hub names, findastra-pet-apps, Documents\Projects) in `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `desktop-pet-20261011.json`, `health-hummy-20261008.html`, `pet.json`, `sprite-20261008.json`.
- **A16 pet.json** — pet.json job differs from the registry. pet.json: "Personal health tracker. Your data stays on your PC and is never committed."
- **A16 pet.json** — pet.json has no audit block (the registry has one).
- **A31 Links** — Link to the hub under its old repo name: repo renamed to astras-pet-os.

<details><summary>What the fix PR changes, exactly</summary>

- Retired names: 7 replacement(s) in AGENTS.md, README.md, desktop-pet-20261011.json, health-hummy-20261008.html, pet.json, sprite-20261008.json (old hub names / findastra-pet-apps -> astras-pet-os and Astra's PetOS, Documents\Projects -> Documents\Astra's PetOS). History lines kept as written.
- pet.json: job now matches the registry; audit block copied from the registry.
- 2026-10-18 refresh: Brought up to date with main (3 new commit(s) there); main's version was kept where both changed a line, and desktop-pet-20261011.json stays deleted as main deleted it. Retired names again after the merge: 2 in AGENTS.md, health-hummy-20261008.html. pet.json: audit block from the registry. Credit line is now "An Intelligent App, or Pet, by Astra." (card 033): 2 change(s) in AGENTS.md, README.md. Art prompts and provenance notes keep their wording.
