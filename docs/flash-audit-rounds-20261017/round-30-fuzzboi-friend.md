**Fix PR waiting for you:** [fuzzboi-friend#2](https://github.com/findastra/fuzzboi-friend/pull/2)

### Exceptions

1. **A57 Current names only** — Incorrect. Retired names (Astra's Pet Apps, astras-pet-apps, findastra-pet-apps, Documents\Projects) in `cage/README.md`.  
   *Next:* Inside code (a storage key or a name the code looks for), so it was left alone tonight.
2. **A16 pet.json** — Missing. Metadata: framework declaration  
   *Next:* Framework metadata comes with the shared page framework (Codex's branch); not added by hand tonight.
3. **A55 Pictures** — Missing. README shows 0 picture(s).  
   *Next:* Needs real pictures of the program working (you take some: card 026).
4. **A18 Tool list** — Missing. No declared tool inventory.  
   *Next:* No tool list yet. It comes with the shared page framework.
5. **A52 L3 activity bubble** — Missing. Required shared L3 activity bubble/config/script/style not found in the inspected entry source.  
   *Next:* Open.
6. **A44 Yellow phone** — Missing. Shared phone baseline not found.  
   *Next:* Open.
7. **A45 Paper and zoom** — Missing. Shared stationery source not found.  
   *Next:* Open.
8. **A41 Clicker Training** — Missing. No Clicker Training section found in the inspected entry source.  
   *Next:* Open.

### Fixed tonight (in the fix PR, waiting for your merge)

- **A57 Current names only** — Retired names (Astra's Pet Apps, astras-pet-apps, findastra-pet-apps, Documents\Projects) in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `desktop-pet-20261011.json`, `sprite-20261009.json`.
- **A16 pet.json** — pet.json job differs from the registry. pet.json: "Makes your own Fuzzboi: type a six-digit hex code and get that exact Fuzzboi, drawn from Astra's layers, as a PNG."
- **A16 pet.json** — pet.json has no audit block (the registry has one).
- **A31 Links** — 2 links point at the old hub name or a missing file: <https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-apps>, <https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-apps/blob/main/PET-WORDS.md>.

<details><summary>What the fix PR changes, exactly</summary>

- Retired names: 14 replacement(s) in AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, cage/README.md, desktop-pet-20261011.json, sprite-20261009.json (astras-pet-apps / findastra-pet-apps -> astras-pet-os, Astra's Pet Apps -> Astra's PetOS, Documents\Projects -> Documents\Astra's PetOS). History lines kept as written.
- pet.json: job now matches the registry; audit block copied from the registry.
- 2026-10-18 refresh: Brought up to date with main (3 new commit(s) there); main's version was kept where both changed a line, and desktop-pet-20261011.json stays deleted as main deleted it. Retired names again after the merge: 1 in AGENTS.md. pet.json: audit block from the registry. Credit line is now "An Intelligent App, or Pet, by Astra." (card 033): 4 change(s) in AGENTS.md, README.md, fuzzboi-friend-20261009.html. Art prompts and provenance notes keep their wording.
