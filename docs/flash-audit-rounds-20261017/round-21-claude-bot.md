### Fixed tonight (in the fix PR, waiting for your merge)

- **A57 Current names only** — Retired names (Astra's Pet Apps, astras-pet-apps, findastra-pet-apps, Documents\Projects) in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `desktop-pet-20261011.json`, `docs/plan-20261009.md`, `skills/handoff/SKILL.md`.
- **A16 pet.json** — pet.json job differs from the registry. pet.json: "A small floating Claude control on the Windows desktop: an orange face, a status bubble and a quick-chat box."
- **A16 pet.json** — pet.json has no audit block (the registry has one).
- **A31 Links** — Broken link https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-apps: repo renamed: astras-pet-apps is now astras-pet-os.

<details><summary>What the fix PR changes, exactly</summary>

- Retired names: 11 replacement(s) in AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, desktop-pet-20261011.json, docs/plan-20261009.md, skills/handoff/SKILL.md (astras-pet-apps / findastra-pet-apps -> astras-pet-os, Astra's Pet Apps -> Astra's PetOS, Documents\Projects -> Documents\Astra's PetOS). History lines kept as written.
- pet.json: job now matches the registry; audit block copied from the registry.
- 2026-10-18 refresh: Brought up to date with main (2 new commit(s) there); where both changed a line, main's version was kept and the fixes below were applied again on top. Retired names again after the merge: 2 in AGENTS.md. pet.json: audit block from the registry. Credit line is now "An Intelligent App, or Pet, by Astra." (card 033): 2 change(s) in AGENTS.md, README.md. Art prompts and provenance notes keep their wording.
