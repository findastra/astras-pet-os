*Nine-emotion sheet: Missing (no art yet; generating it costs money, so it waits for your OK).*

**Fix PR waiting for you:** [patch-cat#2](https://github.com/findastra/patch-cat/pull/2)

### Exceptions

1. **A16 pet.json** — Missing. Metadata: framework declaration  
   *Next:* Framework metadata comes with the shared page framework (Codex's branch); not added by hand tonight.
2. **A17 Git branches** — Incorrect. 2 branch(es) with work not on main and no open pull request: codex/l3-activity-20261016 (+2), codex/yellow-phone-20261015 (+1).  
   *Next:* See Decisions: open a pull request, merge, or leave each branch.
3. **A55 Pictures** — Missing. README shows 1 picture(s).  
   *Next:* Needs real pictures of the program working (you take some: card 026).
4. **A18 Tool list** — Missing. No declared tool inventory.  
   *Next:* No tool list yet. It comes with the shared page framework.

### Fixed tonight (in the fix PR, waiting for your merge)

- **A57 Current names only** — Retired names (Astra's Pet Apps, astras-pet-apps, findastra-pet-apps, Documents\Projects) in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `desktop-pet-20261011.json`, `pet.json`.
- **A16 pet.json** — pet.json has no audit block (the registry has one).
- **A31 Links** — 2 links point at the old hub name or a missing file: <https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-apps/blob/main/handoffs/008-farmer-register-new-placeholders.md>, <https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-apps>.

<details><summary>What the fix PR changes, exactly</summary>

- Retired names: 8 replacement(s) in AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, desktop-pet-20261011.json, pet.json (astras-pet-apps / findastra-pet-apps -> astras-pet-os, Astra's Pet Apps -> Astra's PetOS, Documents\Projects -> Documents\Astra's PetOS). History lines kept as written.
- pet.json: audit block copied from the registry.
- README: the stale "Not in the Cage yet ... card 008" line now says it is a pipeline pet in pets.json (card 008 is an old dropped draft).
- 2026-10-18 refresh: Brought up to date with main (3 new commit(s) there); main's version was kept where both changed a line, and desktop-pet-20261011.json stays deleted as main deleted it. Retired names again after the merge: 2 in AGENTS.md, README.md. pet.json: audit block from the registry. README: the stale card 008 line now says it is a pipeline pet. Credit line is now "An Intelligent App, or Pet, by Astra." (card 033): 2 change(s) in AGENTS.md, README.md. Art prompts and provenance notes keep their wording.

### Decisions

1. **Branches with work not on main** and no pull request: [`codex/l3-activity-20261016`](https://github.com/findastra/patch-cat/compare/main...codex%2Fl3-activity-20261016) (+2), [`codex/yellow-phone-20261015`](https://github.com/findastra/patch-cat/compare/main...codex%2Fyellow-phone-20261015) (+1). Open a PR, merge, or leave?
2. **Merge the fix PR** [patch-cat#2](https://github.com/findastra/patch-cat/pull/2)? It only holds fixes that need no decision (listed above).

**Tools:** none declared in pet.json yet (A18).  
**Tutorial tools:** Play with, Care for — Not verified overnight.
