### Fixed tonight (in the fix PR, waiting for your merge)

- **A57 Current names only** — Retired names (Astra's Pet Apps, astras-pet-apps, findastra-pet-apps, Documents\Projects) in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `desktop-pet-20261011.json`, `pet.json`.
- **A16 pet.json** — pet.json job differs from the registry. pet.json: "Placeholder: a backup pet. The job is not decided yet."
- **A16 pet.json** — pet.json has no audit block (the registry has one).
- **A31 Links** — 2 links point at the old hub name or a missing file: <https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-apps>, <https://github.com/findastra/astras-pet-apps/blob/main/handoffs/008-farmer-register-new-placeholders.md>.

<details><summary>What the fix PR changes, exactly</summary>

- Retired names: 11 replacement(s) in AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, desktop-pet-20261011.json, pet.json (astras-pet-apps / findastra-pet-apps -> astras-pet-os, Astra's Pet Apps -> Astra's PetOS, Documents\Projects -> Documents\Astra's PetOS). History lines kept as written.
- pet.json: job now matches the registry; audit block copied from the registry.
- README: the stale "Not in the Cage yet ... card 008" line now says it is a pipeline pet in pets.json (card 008 is an old dropped draft).
- 2026-10-18 refresh: Brought up to date with main (3 new commit(s) there); main's version was kept where both changed a line, and desktop-pet-20261011.json stays deleted as main deleted it. Retired names again after the merge: 2 in AGENTS.md, README.md. pet.json: audit block from the registry. README: the stale card 008 line now says it is a pipeline pet. Credit line is now "An Intelligent App, or Pet, by Astra." (card 033): 2 change(s) in AGENTS.md, README.md. Art prompts and provenance notes keep their wording.
