# Flash Audit: pet onboarding and review instruction sheet

Working name: **Flash Audit**. Owner: **GitHub Goldfish**, program **GitHub Aquarium**.
Tool label: `github-aquarium-v1.0-flash-audit-v1.0`.
By Astra. Compiled with OpenAI Codex (GPT-6), 2026-10-14.

This is a usable manual audit procedure and a specification for a future tool interface.
Goldfish now also has a read-only local metadata preflight at `scripts/flash-audit-local-20261015.mjs`. It is not a complete automated auditor, deployed service, or security certification.
Use it for new pets, existing pets, and the restarted rapid-question review of every pet.
Goldfish owns the audit; the Farmer owns registry/admission coordination. No new pet is needed.

## 1. Source rules and precedence

Read the target repository's current AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, every applicable SKILL.md,
open handoffs, and pet.json before changing it. Fetch and inspect remote branches for
relevant unpublished work; record the branch and commit actually audited. Do not run
untrusted repository code merely to inspect it.

The sheet combines Astra's approved audit matrix and latest instructions with:

- [Pet files](../PET-FILES.md): required files, metadata, art, audit schedule, submission.
- [Pet Program Framework](../PET-PROGRAM-FRAMEWORK.md): page, tools, chat, backlog, data and links.
- [New pet or tool](../skills/new-pet-or-tool/SKILL.md): ownership and admission decisions.
- [Farm security](../skills/farm-security/SKILL.md) and [protection rings](../PROTECTION-RINGS.md).
- [Canonical architecture](../ASTRAS_PET_OS.md), [pet words](../PET-WORDS.md),
  [intelligence levels](../INTELLIGENCE-LEVELS.md), and [handoff rules](../skills/handoff/SKILL.md).
- [Security implementation limits](security-boundaries-20261014.md): planned enforcement
  must never be reported as deployed protection.

GitHub main source snapshot inspected: `04cb6416015f02478f716c0869f31066ff8133cd`.
The earlier left-side maintenance-control refinement and selected names are on the Codex working
branch, checkpoint `6ecb54b`, not necessarily main. Re-read current sources each run.

Resolve conflicts explicitly: direct owner instructions take precedence; the canonical
architecture governs conflicting legacy product descriptions. The Cage is retired as
a product concept: preserve compatibility files but do not demand new Cage behavior.
Missing optional software that was never installed is asleep / "not on this PC",
not a defect. A selected required connection that needs the owner is a blocked check.
Do not overwrite approved artwork to satisfy older generic palette/accessory rules.
Keep stable IDs and compatibility filenames unless a migration is authorized.
If source rules remain contradictory, report the conflict rather than silently choosing.

## 2. Run procedure

1. Load the canonical numbered catalog and registry; preserve chosen names and stable IDs.
   Include registered, pipeline, seed and roadmap pets, with their stage shown honestly.
2. Select one pet. Record program/icon names, number, owner repo, branches/commits,
   local source, deployed URL/version, and what access is actually available.
3. Show its current icon and nine-emotion sheet. Inspect desktop, page and repo versions.
4. Run the matrix below. Store evidence for every result, including passes. Do not infer
   a working app from HTTP 200, a file's existence, a passing build, or a successful launch request.
5. Tell Astra only **Missing**, **Incorrect**, and **Not verified** findings. Do not list
   successful checks. Artwork and unresolved questions remain visible as review materials.
6. Ask rapid questions only for unresolved decisions: four name suggestions with a short
   explanation each plus free text; implemented vs approved-planned vs proposed tools;
   integrations and an add-your-own option. Keep existing choices unless Astra changes them.
7. Save answers immediately. Apply only authorized fixes; audit permission is not permission
   to connect accounts, send mail, delete data, install software, or grant access.
8. Recheck affected items, publish a branch checkpoint and record what remains. Advance
   through the list without marking unchecked items complete.

### Mandatory checkpoint and preview after every round

After **each round**, and after substantial owner corrections within a round:

1. Save decisions, evidence, unresolved questions, next pet number and remaining count
   to a dated repository audit record before relying on chat history. Preserve answers
   across context/token limits. Distinguish reviewed rounds from repaired applications.
2. Run checks appropriate to the changes, commit the round's authorized files and push
   to GitHub. Verify push success and record the branch/commit. If nothing changed,
   verify synchronization without making an empty commit. Do not reset other work.
3. Refresh the existing right-side preview after changing its displayed content, so
   Astra can inspect the result. Preserve entered data; do not reload a dirty form
   without addressing unsaved work. Keep the relevant preview visible for the round.
4. A public GitHub Pages view only changes after deployment. A branch push does not
   deploy or authorize merging. Refresh/check after confirmed deployment and say plainly
   when the public page remains old. For documentation-only changes, show the updated
   instruction/audit file; do not suggest the unchanged app has been updated.
5. Hand off the next round with exact progress and open decisions. Never count a
   Not verified check as passed merely to finish a round.

Current visual checks A44-A51 appear below and are part of this matrix.

## 3. Complete audit matrix

| ID | Check | Evidence required / exception to report |
|---|---|---|
| A01 | Current icon | Show the actual image; identify desktop and page sources. Report absent, stale or inconsistent art. |
| A02 | Nine emotions | Show Sleepy, Awake, Idle, Curious, Happy, Worried, Alarmed, Sick and Sad; inspect all frames for missing, duplicate, mislabeled or inconsistent expressions. |
| A03 | Emotion behavior | Verify each state is reachable and means the correct runtime condition, not just that its PNG exists. Legacy filenames may remain stable; labels use the current nine states. Blink is an animation only. |
| A04 | Art publication | Compare local active assets with individual-repo blobs, including sheet, frames and sprite metadata. Report unpushed or stale art and invalid paths. |
| A05 | Art format and provenance | Check transparent 256px source frames, approved style/body/size, black outline, no unwanted sparkles, source/license, and owner exceptions. Separate source resolution from desktop display size. |
| A06 | Pet name | Compare mascot name across page, registry, map and metadata. Report conflicts, typos and placeholders. |
| A07 | Program name/version | Preserve chosen names; check versioned labels and stable numbers. Ask four suggestions plus custom only where undecided. |
| A08 | Purpose and scope | Compare intended job with actual behavior; distinguish program, runtime and harness. Flag overlaps and planned features claimed as built. |
| A09 | Program interface | Inspect a real interface and required framework sections. Flag missing page, placeholder, dead controls or incomplete blocks. |
| A10 | Website route | Open configured program URL, follow redirects and inspect destination. Flag repo links posing as applications, wrong apps, errors and unexplained auth gates. |
| A11 | Desktop launch | Exercise the actual pet's double-click and verify the intended interface appears. If unavailable, mark Not verified. |
| A12 | Map/catalog navigation | Check icon/program links, program-to-map node link, stable identity and correct relationships in both directions. |
| A13 | Individual repo | Verify repo association, source, entry point, metadata and artwork. Look at relevant branches before saying work is absent. |
| A14 | Required repo files | Check pet.json, sprite target, entry target, README, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, LICENSE and applicable pet-app topic. |
| A15 | README and credit | Check how-to-run and Limits, public credit "A pet app by Astra", model/version/date, license, truthful status and naming exceptions. |
| A16 | Metadata and self-audit | Validate pet.json including job, runs_on, entry, sprite, status, framework, tools, links and audit cadence/subject/needs. Hatching/growing/grown must reflect evidence. |
| A17 | Git and deployment | Record dirty files, ahead/behind commits, pushed branch, merged state and deployed version separately. Do not reset/stash/discard another agent's work. |
| A18 | Official tool inventory | Separate implemented, owner-approved planned, and proposed tools. Record purpose, version, owner, permissions, dependencies and add-your-own decisions. |
| A19 | Tool behavior | Verify inputs, outputs, errors and intended actions for each tool. Use safe fixtures for changing actions; live checks require authorized scope. |
| A20 | Manual maintenance light | Every tool has a left-side blue/orange maintenance light, distinct from ON/OFF and automatic health. Report persists to backlog/Farmer; tests cannot silently clear it. |
| A21 | Tool OFF enforcement | Verify execution actually stops/prevents new work, state is controlled outside the tool, and security OFF cannot be self-reenabled. Report unsupported enforcement as a gap. |
| A22 | Chatbot and seat status | Click the exact pet-icon launcher; verify the shared chat panel, header [Pet name] Chat in the original yellow phone, actual L3 connection/model/task, consent, replies, close/reopen and honest disconnected state. A rendered panel alone is not a functioning chatbot. |
| A23 | Chat-created tools | Verify request capture, authorized agent dispatch, build progress, independent review, tests, version registration and list entry. No self-granted access. |
| A24 | Ready indicator | Green plus text refers to a checked version; connection and authorization are separate. Failures or unreviewed code cannot appear ready. |
| A25 | Integrations/accounts | Check supported services, feature detection, account selection, connection denial, expiry, disconnect and provider-specific limits. No connection from domain guessing alone. |
| A26 | Privacy and permissions | Check exact allowed data/actions, owner approvals, secret storage and untrusted inputs. No private data or credentials in public repos/reports. |
| A27 | Preview and recovery | For changes, verify appropriate preview/approval, undo or recovery, partial failures, retry safety and audit records. |
| A28 | Pet connections | Verify sender/receiver, purpose, granted scope, actual data flow, last exchange and independent connection OFF. Match registry relations and map. |
| A29 | Notes/backlog | Verify notes, screenshots, requests and defect reports persist, retain tool/version association, and reach the actual destination. |
| A30 | Data continuity | Verify export/import, schema version, backup/migration on update and persistence across versions. Private test data stays private. |
| A31 | Status and link labels | Check data owner, last entry, update/version, seat, map node, and links grouped by kind with origin/location/visibility labels. |
| A32 | Pet Collar and release trust | Check provenance, signature claims, install/update history and recovery evidence. Planned signing is not verified signing. |
| A33 | Registration/admission | Check candidate/pipeline/registered stage, owner admission, pet-app discovery, registration handoff and dated submission. No automatic trust from discovery. |
| A34 | Generated artifacts/tests | Use canonical sources/builders; check generated registry/docs/art, documented build/check/tests, visual inspection and relevant runtime acceptance. |
| A35 | Handoff and unresolved work | Record exact evidence, commits, touched files, remaining issues, owners and next steps. Say explicitly what is only on a branch. |
| A36 | First-visit tutorial | The Farm has tutorial-tools and a reopenable first-time-here-tutorial. Its page tool box launches the L3 chatbot into that tutorial and retains a left-side maintenance light and separate ON/OFF switch. Verify OFF prevents launch/stops the active tour. |
| A37 | Play and care SOPs | Every pet has Play with and Care for numbered SOPs delivered in L3 chat. Click each page-listed tutorial tool; verify correct chat context, real steps, prerequisites, expected results, version and stop/help path. No standalone tutorial page or fictional steps for planned features. |
| A38 | Tool organization | Verify browsing by pet, subject category and nested groups, search and multi-category tags, while one canonical tool retains its identity/owner. Distinguish health category from software-health status. |
| A39 | Pet-icon navigation | Every cross-pet program hyperlink is the current pet icon, with accessible name, tooltip, keyboard focus and usable hit area. Check real destination, hosted/local assets and offline behavior where applicable. Missing program route shows unavailable, not a repo substituted as the program. |
| A40 | Guided focus and functioning tour | Exercise Next/Back/Pause/Resume/Exit. Only a step number and soft border/background glow appear at the real target; explanations remain in chat. Verify scroll/resize alignment, missing-target handling, keyboard access, reduced motion, and cleanup on completion/OFF. Verify actual user-visible results, not just source/tests. |
| A41 | Clicker Training | Every program has a bordered list of real desktop click bindings. One click shows the most important emotion-linked message; two clicks show/hide the Pet Program window (background work is controlled separately); three clicks runs an explicitly assigned quick tool. Verify sequence disambiguation, drag suppression, OFF/permissions and honest unavailable states before claiming native support. |
| A42 | Credential help | Adjacent (?) What is this hover/focus memo explains optionality, purpose, scope, storage and destination without exposing secrets. |
| A43 | Emotion/message hierarchy | Verify simultaneous conditions select one highest-priority unresolved message and matching emotion using explicit policy, not frame order. Test stale success, failure, owner-needed state, dismissal and cosmetic blink. Missing global hierarchy is Not verified, not an invented priority order. |

Harness seats are model-independent through supported authorized adapters. Do not
force a single provider choice or claim every model already connects automatically.

## 4. New-pet onboarding gate

Before creating anything, decide whether the work belongs to an existing pet. A new pet
needs a distinct program, data and schedule that no current owner covers. A tool belongs
to its parent program and gets no additional permissions merely by existing.

For an approved new pet:

1. Obtain required owner approval for a new repository/admission, paid art and connections.
   Reuse the canonical local checkout; work on an assistant branch.
2. Create required repo files and metadata, including a real entry and sprite file, audit
   block, framework/tool declarations and the pet-app topic. Rules link back to this hub.
3. Use lowercase dated names for new ordinary files. Required names such as pet.json,
   AGENTS.md, README.md and LICENSE conflict with the generic naming rule: surface that
   exception before creating them. Do not rename existing required files.
4. Keep art a draft until approved. Preserve approved reference sheets; never reroll the
   whole herd for one change. Follow the current art pipeline and Chip's native-art exception.
   Preserve Mommy's Mommies as one shared sprite. Use approved mood overlays where applicable.
5. Submit metadata changes through dated cage.submit for the existing compatibility path;
   leave a Farmer registration card. Discovery/pipeline presence does not grant access.
6. Have the Farmer coordinate registry/art/relations; owner approval precedes admission.
   Build generated outputs from canonical sources rather than editing generated files.
7. Run this audit, documented checks and relevant live acceptance. Unbuilt seed functionality
   is recorded as Missing (planned), not a fabricated runtime failure.
8. Commit/push the approved scope, record branch/commit and handoff, and distinguish merge
   and deployment. Do not mark grown merely because the files pass a static check.

## 5. Results and rapid-question format

Keep a private evidence ledger per run: run ID/date, pet/program number, check ID,
status (Pass / Missing / Incorrect / Not verified / Not applicable), evidence location,
source commit/deployed version, impact, proposed fix, owner decision and retest result.
Not applicable needs a reason. Missing access is Not verified, never Pass.
Do not publish personal paths, addresses, mailbox contents or credentials with evidence.

Owner-facing round:

Use a strict **Tools:** list with one exact tool name per line and its status.
List **Tutorial tools:** separately, currently Play with and Care for, rather than
mixing them into the regular tool inventory.
Where source has only a feature/button and no official tool ID, label the suggested
ID **proposed name for existing feature**. Keep implemented source, live deployment,
approved plans and new proposals distinct. Follow with exceptions keyed to tool name
or Program-wide, then a short keep/add/remove/rename question. Never substitute a
vague grouped description for the individual tool list.

> **Round N: icon name — program name**
>
> Current icon and labeled nine-emotion sheet (or Missing).
>
> **Exceptions:** check ID, Missing/Incorrect/Not verified, one plain sentence and next action.
>
> **Decisions:** only unresolved names, tools, integrations, artwork choices or scope.
> Give four explained name options and free text; allow adding tools in plain language.

If no exceptions remain, use one line: "No exceptions found in the checks completed."
Do not claim an unaudited pet, live interaction, security boundary or deployment passed.

## 6. Goldfish tool contract and remaining implementation

The manual procedure can be used now. Its future tool box must have the versioned label,
left-side maintenance light, enforced ON/OFF, scope selector, run/progress/cancel,
exception matrix, evidence links, review questions and exportable report. Account access
must be declared; read-only inspection is the default. Repair is a separate authorized action.

Goldfish's pet.json and README record partial implementation: manual instructions plus
the read-only local preflight. The complete interactive audit flow is still pending.
No MCP endpoint or schedule is created by this sheet or the local CLI.

## 7. Name suggestions (unselected alternatives)

Owner refinement, 2026-10-14: tutorial-tools belongs to The Farm; each pet owns its
Play with / Care for numbered SOPs, indexed by The Farm. Cross-pet navigation uses
icon hyperlinks throughout the programs. The shared framework defines these standards;
checks A36-A40 enforce them. Tutorials run in L3 chat, launched from page tool boxes
that retain manual health reporting and ON/OFF. This supersedes the earlier standalone,
agent-optional tutorial wording. These are requirements, not implemented UI claims.

- **Flash Audit**: the owner's working name; quick rounds backed by thorough checks.
- **Fin Check**: short and specific to GitHub Goldfish. Recommended pet-themed option.
- **School Inspection**: a school of fish reviewing the whole pet collection.
- **Pet Collar Check**: emphasizes identity, provenance and readiness, though the audit
  also covers behavior and tools beyond the collar.

Keep Flash Audit until Astra chooses otherwise; no renaming based on suggestions alone.

## Current visual checks A44–A51 — owner corrections, 2026-10-15

These replace the October 14 coin, pink-theme, hidden-control and never-wrap footer rules.

| ID | Check | Evidence required |
|---|---|---|
| A44 | Original yellow phone | Shared original Chip shell; current pet artwork; opens the actual pet chat without coin geometry or spinning animation. Preserve existing host handlers. |
| A45 | Paper and zoom | Portrait paper width; normal initial view; Ctrl+wheel from full-page fit to 100%, no zoom bar; no horizontal overflow at 390px. Real browser acceptance is separate from handler tests. |
| A46 | Program launch rows | Third Party Programs then Your Programs: square cloud-framed app icons with accessible names and real bounded launch routes; installer labels distinguish installation from an installed app. |
| A47 | Shared base | Your Tools followed by Your Tutorials/Your Notes side by side, stacking on narrow screens; exactly two Play/Care tutorials; visible Clicker Training and About. |
| A48 | Paired lights | Left-side stacked green/red ON/OFF and blue/orange manual maintenance lights; fixed spacing and common positioning; visible closed or open; tooltips, keyboard focus, persisted state and actual gates. |
| A49 | Emotion key | Sleepy, Awake, Idle, Curious, Happy, Worried, Alarmed, Sick, Sad in 3/2/1 columns. Label in white rounded bubble border, pet on right; blink is animation, not a state. Describe actual signal/threshold sources and unknown queues. |
| A50 | Backdrop and text | Each pet has a distinct stationery palette; Damsel blue wrinkles, purple/light-blue controls and restrained neon-pink sparkles. All text has a deliberate surface. No approved pet art regenerated. |
| A51 | Footer | Centered, spacious, slightly staggered wrapping groups between thin rules; status, Made by Astra/date, social icons and static Farmer home icon. No coin or horizontal scrollbar. Verify all links remain reachable. |
| A52 | L3 activity bubble | Every Pet Program has a visible yellow **[Pet name] · L3 activity** bubble, green LCD and black outline near the top. Show actual provider/task/session, timestamps and concise bounded events. Verify disconnected, idle, working, awaiting review, complete, error, OFF and stale states against a real authorized host. No invented activity, secrets, raw prompts or automatic job launch. The source preflight reports Missing or Not verified, never runtime Pass from an embed marker. Check desktop/mobile layout and persistence after regeneration. |

## Mandatory Clicker Training preservation — owner correction, 2026-10-15

A41 is a required shared Pet Program control, not an optional tutorial or a chat-launcher description. Every page must visibly retain a bordered Clicker Training section with One click, Two clicks, and Three clicks rows. Do not collapse it into a generic Click bindings bubble, remove it during a layout migration, or replace it with phone/chat instructions. Display the actual assigned quick tool and verification state; say unassigned or not verified where appropriate. Audit desktop and 390px mobile layouts, and confirm the section remains after regeneration. Native timing, drag suppression, permissions and OFF checks remain required before claiming the desktop bindings work.

Recorded by OpenAI Codex (GPT-6).


### Owner visual standard — 2026-10-15
Every visible text item must sit inside a bubble, card, label plate, or other intentional background; never leave raw copy floating on the stationery. Emotion labels use the normal page text color, set into the rounded speech-bubble border, with the pet on the right. Status and emotion settings need their own surfaces. Keep the portrait sheet fixed in width and let footer groups wrap into spacious, slightly staggered rows between its top and bottom rules. No horizontal footer scrollbar, clipping, or hidden footer links. Verify at desktop and mobile widths; preserve Clicker Training.


### Base structure and application launchers — owner correction 2026-10-15
Order: Third Party Programs, Your Programs, Your Tools, then one shared two-column section with Your Tutorials on the left and Your Notes on the right. Stack that pair on narrow screens. Preserve Clicker Training and About below it. Application rows use square cloud-framed tiles containing actual application icons and names, with one-click launch actions; do not hide launchers behind a disclosure or send an installed-app launcher to a marketing website. Clearly distinguish installers from standalone apps (BetterDiscord opens its verified installer; it is a Discord modification). Launch routes must be fixed and bounded, with visible failure feedback. Verify the real application launch separately from rendering. No invented app integrations. Damsel uses slightly deeper blue wrinkled stationery with purple/light-blue controls and small neon-pink accents; no pink base theme or sharp diagonal folds.


Tool controls standard (2026-10-15): two compact glossy, lightly sparkling status-light buttons stacked together on the left edge of each tool bubble, vertically centered when possible and aligned at the top for expanded content. Keep a fixed 6px gap between the lights; move the pair as one unit. Top: green on / red off. Bottom: blue working / orange owner-marked maintenance. No visible ON or Not Working text. Keep title tooltips, explicit accessible state labels, keyboard focus and reduced-motion support. Both lamps remain usable when collapsed or disabled; maintenance toggles persist and feed existing health reporting. Blue is the manual health flag, not proof of a successful runtime check.


Owner correction, 2026-10-15: cloud-shaped square tiles are for Third Party Programs only. OpenAI and Anthropic presence controllers belong under Your Tools in the regular rounded tool bubbles, with their paired left lights and Discord-style profile-card previews inside. Other owner-created programs use regular program/tool bubbles rather than third-party cloud tiles. Hide an empty Your Programs row.
